					<p>In urban environments, infrastructure components are not isolated. Due to their close proximity, they interact with one another during earthquakes by affecting the static and dynamic stresses in the underlying interface soil. The research objective is to identify the key predictors of the performance of a building cluster on softened ground by: (1) performing centrifuge experiments to fundamentally evaluate multiple structure-soil-structure interaction on liquefiable ground and the impact and relative importance of the properties of building, ground motion, mitigation strategy, and cluster on the EDPs of structure and surrounding soil; (2) developing validated nonlinear numerical models of the coupled structure-soil-structure systems that are studied experimentally; and (3) performing a preliminary parametric study with the calibrated numerical models to define the most efficient ground motion predicting parameters of the performance of building clusters on softened ground. The undergraduate student involved in this project will be heavily involved in centrifuge modeling and data processing/visualization component of this research.

						A GPA > 3.6 is required. It is recommended to have taken Geotech 1 and 2 (CVEN 3708 and 3718) and have obtained a grade above A- in those courses. For students from disciplines outside of civil engineering, this is not required. The student should be interested in earthquake engineering and experimental research, instrumentation, signal processing, and working with other students and researchers.

					<p>The goal of the ninja car project is to demonstrate on-board perception, planning and control algorithms for driving ground vehicles capable of dynamic “gymnastic moves” such as jumping, drifting, rolling, bouncing, tumbling or wall-driving. This capability for fast, lightweight autonomous ground vehicles is possible due to the confluence of innovative algorithms for perception, planning and control, as well as new actuators and small form factor computing. Our platform of choice is a small 1/8th scale off-road racing vehicle, modified with sensing, jump-actuation and on-board computing. Our goal is to reliably automate the execution of these dynamic, “gymnastic” maneuvers. We envision ninja cars launching off inclined surfaces, bouncing down walls, jumping through open windows, much like human parkour runners fly through urban spaces today. The question arises: where can such a novel class of vehicle actually drive?  How much of the world is accessible to this class of vehicle? These platforms will be useful in a variety of contexts including cluttered terrain navigation, long-term surveillance, and high-speed pursuit using a variety of novel control maneuvers, such as jumping.

					<p>Micro-grids for Smart Villages is a collaboration of UCB faculty, the Mortenson Center for Engineering in Developing Communities (MC-EDC), The IEEE Smart Village Program (ISV) and L’Institut Technique de la Côte-Sud (ITCS), Coteaux, Sud-Ouest, Haiti. The Haitian electrical power distribution grid was accessible to only about 10\% of the population before the earthquake of January 2010. Much of that infrastructure was destroyed. Practically, the Haitian grid of the future will have to grow from localized green energy farms be they photovoltaic, micro/pico hydro and/or wind. This development will require the training of a Haitian green energy work force as well as fundamentally new knowledge about design of power grids that are fundamentally variable in output. A micro-grid developed in Sud-Ouest, Haiti was devastated during Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. We have recently installed a micro-grid at are partners (ITCS) training site in southwest Haiti. We will continue monitoring as well as expanding this micro-grid. Students working with the program will assist in green energy research while interfacing with students, practitioners and researchers in Haiti. /

					<p>The engagement of the Mickelson group in applications of rural telecommunications (Nepal, Peru, Cameroon, Papua New Guinea (PNG)) is longstanding (a decade). The group has worked cooperatively with various Universities, NGOs, health entities, government entities and funding agencies (Venture, IEEE - Foundation, Humanitarian Activities Committee (HAC) and Smart Village (SV)) on health, education and commerce projects. The group is presently constructing a Wi-Fi Long Distance Testbed here in Boulder in order to pre-test wireless equipment before jungle/mountain installations far from home. New equipment for this highly innovative technology is constantly appearing as is simulation software. The group has also been testing innovative power supply solutions for the mainly solar powered Industry, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band installations. There is an option for students working with us here to who have interest in rural telecommunications to join us during assessment, installation and evaluation trips to distant locations.  /

					<p>Optical fiber is the chosen medium for high data rate (Gbps) interconnections that are longer than circa 10 meters. Most recently, fiber has been applied to interconnecting the rack tops of warehouse scale data centers (WSC’s). Fiber itself is only useful for point to point interconnections. Electronics distributes signals to optical modulators for multiplexing and from optical detectors for processing. Integrated optical technologies in semiconductors are becoming more sophisticated. Such technologies can be be used to integrate operations of modulation, multiplexing and switching using chip real estate almost as compact as those offered by electronics. These integrated optical technologies have yet to find widespread use in networks primarily because of problems of interconnecting them to electronics, optical fiber but more importantly in the case of data centers and supercomputers, finding a compelling need. For example, operations that are better performed optically in those data racks that are fiber optically linked together. In this work we are investigating compelling needs through modeling and experiment.

					<p>This project is focused on organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) as a biosensing platform. OECTs are used in applications ranging from measurements of epileptic activity and neuron action potentials to measurements of metabolic activity in cancerous cells. Our work is focused on the device physics and materials science of OECTs and the development of faster transistors with higher signal-to-noise ratios. Undergraduate work on this project will primarily be the optimization of novel methods for patterning organic materials. The undergraduate on this project will learn to fabricate OECTs using microfabrication techniques including photolithography, metal deposition, and reactive ion etching. Additionally, the undergraduate will learn to use characterization tools such as source-meter-units for electrical testing and contact profilometers for measurement of device dimensions and surface quality.

					<p>Looking for a student to help in modeling of electrostatic interactions on spacecraft. This work will aid in the design of an electrostatic tractor beam and the better understanding or electromagnet perturbations.  The applications include using the E-Tractor to tug large, tumbling space debris to disposal orbits or to use modulated electrostatic control fields to despin and service a satellite.   /  / The Multi-Sphere Method (MSM) has been used for rigid conductors with great results. The thrust of the proposed project will be to extend MSM to flexible bodies and dielectrics. Student will be working on the mathematical modeling side primarily with some electrostatic plasma chamber experiments for support.
