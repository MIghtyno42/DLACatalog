Examples include planners protesting for housing justice, architects advocating for gender equity within their profession, and civil engineers opposing unethical infrastructure projects. But what does this look like online? Through this project, students will investigate how engineers use social media channels to protest and mobilize political power.

						<p>Perceptual learning is the technique of showing many training instances to a human learner, usually in visual manner, and forcing the learner to make a prediction/label while providing feedback. When done appropriately, this can develop a gut instinct in the learner, which appears to be how many human experts operate (i.e., a chess master can glance at a chess board and quickly form a first impression about the strength of a position; a forester can glance at a far-off tree and guess the species).  There is some software to automate this, called perceptual learning modules (PLM), but these PLM require the user to input a training set of labeled images which is clearly very time consuming. This project would create a PLM website that uses google image search to automatically generate the training set, so that the user specifies only the labels (such as “pine tree” and “spruce tree”) and the website generates corresponding training images. Students must be comfortable with web programming (accessing data via API’s, and building dynamic webpages).

						<p>This research project explores the future of textiles, the materials that make up clothes, drapery and upholstery. New methods for combining smart materials and conductive threads allow us to create textiles that can change color and shape in response to computational data. For instance, your shirt might change its pattern upon receiving and email or a stripe could travel between your shirt and the shirt of a nearby friend. A key challenge in developing new interactive behaviors for textiles is the lack of design software for creating and simulating different interactive behaviors. Thus, I am seeking a student who can help design software interfaces for programmable knitting and weaving machines that will allow people to design and simulate various computational behaviors on fabrics. This will involve learning both about traditional fabric production techniques like weaving and knitting; learning about various "smart" materials that can be integrated into fabric; and developing deeper knowledge of electronics and circuitry. This position will require both hands on construction of smart textiles as well as software work.  /  /

						<p>The popularity of devices like FitBits and other fitness trackers as a way to collect data about everyday activities (steps, calories burned, distance traveled) have changed how we think about the kinds of data that can be collected from our "everyday" activities and used to self-reflect about what makes us happier, healthier, more productive, or more stressed. These kinds of "trace data" can also be collected about other activities that we undertake during the course of a typical day -- for example, the ways that we work with our computers and mobile devices, the information that we share with others, the places that we go when we're working (and not), and our patterns of working time and leisure time. All of these bits of information help to paint a picture about how we get things done a day-to-day basis, with whom, and when our "getting things done" is making us happy...and when it isn't. In this project, a DLA apprentice will work with an interdisciplinary INFO/CS research group to build tools that will collect data about the when, where, who, and with-whom that information work takes place, as well as dashboards to help people make sense of these everyday activity "traces."

Next steps may include conducting interviews with students during their junior year, observations of current seniors on their projects, and with graduates of the CS program from the past few years. Conducting interviews and analyzing responses for patterns will be performed. /  / In addition, we are interested in designing surveys to automatically collect information about how students actually value and make use of software engineering practices. Why do students not make use of best practices during their coursework?

						<p>The purpose of this DLA project is to study the experiences and perceptions of individuals as they move from capstone courses into workplaces. It is increasingly important that we prepare our new engineering graduates to quickly and effectively contribute to the engineering workplace, and capstone design courses are central to this preparation. However, research highlights the differences between that which engineers do at work and the kinds of training they receive in school. Using a multi-case approach, this investigation seeks to understand how and to what extent capstone design courses prepare students to effectively enter communities of practice in engineering workplaces. The DLA student will meet weekly with faculty and be involved in collecting and analyzing data obtained through qualitative interviews and weekly reflective workplace surveys as well as selecting the cohort for the next year of the investigation. The anticipated findings include answers to research questions regarding preparation, developed skills, and important teaching practices that enable us to better understand how students move from capstone design courses into engineering workplaces. /  /
