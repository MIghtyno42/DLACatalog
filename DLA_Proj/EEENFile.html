					<p>In urban environments, infrastructure components are not isolated. Due to their close proximity, they interact with one another during earthquakes by affecting the static and dynamic stresses in the underlying interface soil. The research objective is to identify the key predictors of the performance of a building cluster on softened ground by: (1) performing centrifuge experiments to fundamentally evaluate multiple structure-soil-structure interaction on liquefiable ground and the impact and relative importance of the properties of building, ground motion, mitigation strategy, and cluster on the EDPs of structure and surrounding soil; (2) developing validated nonlinear numerical models of the coupled structure-soil-structure systems that are studied experimentally; and (3) performing a preliminary parametric study with the calibrated numerical models to define the most efficient ground motion predicting parameters of the performance of building clusters on softened ground. The undergraduate student involved in this project will be heavily involved in centrifuge modeling and data processing/visualization component of this research.

					<p>The goal of the ninja car project is to demonstrate on-board perception, planning and control algorithms for driving ground vehicles capable of dynamic “gymnastic moves” such as jumping, drifting, rolling, bouncing, tumbling or wall-driving. This capability for fast, lightweight autonomous ground vehicles is possible due to the confluence of innovative algorithms for perception, planning and control, as well as new actuators and small form factor computing. Our platform of choice is a small 1/8th scale off-road racing vehicle, modified with sensing, jump-actuation and on-board computing. Our goal is to reliably automate the execution of these dynamic, “gymnastic” maneuvers. We envision ninja cars launching off inclined surfaces, bouncing down walls, jumping through open windows, much like human parkour runners fly through urban spaces today. The question arises: where can such a novel class of vehicle actually drive?  How much of the world is accessible to this class of vehicle? These platforms will be useful in a variety of contexts including cluttered terrain navigation, long-term surveillance, and high-speed pursuit using a variety of novel control maneuvers, such as jumping.

					<p>Micro-grids for Smart Villages is a collaboration of UCB faculty, the Mortenson Center for Engineering in Developing Communities (MC-EDC), The IEEE Smart Village Program (ISV) and L’Institut Technique de la Côte-Sud (ITCS), Coteaux, Sud-Ouest, Haiti. The Haitian electrical power distribution grid was accessible to only about 10\% of the population before the earthquake of January 2010. Much of that infrastructure was destroyed. Practically, the Haitian grid of the future will have to grow from localized green energy farms be they photovoltaic, micro/pico hydro and/or wind. This development will require the training of a Haitian green energy work force as well as fundamentally new knowledge about design of power grids that are fundamentally variable in output. A micro-grid developed in Sud-Ouest, Haiti was devastated during Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. We have recently installed a micro-grid at are partners (ITCS) training site in southwest Haiti. We will continue monitoring as well as expanding this micro-grid. Students working with the program will assist in green energy research while interfacing with students, practitioners and researchers in Haiti. /

					<p>Optical fiber is the chosen medium for high data rate (Gbps) interconnections that are longer than circa 10 meters. Most recently, fiber has been applied to interconnecting the rack tops of warehouse scale data centers (WSC’s). Fiber itself is only useful for point to point interconnections. Electronics distributes signals to optical modulators for multiplexing and from optical detectors for processing. Integrated optical technologies in semiconductors are becoming more sophisticated. Such technologies can be be used to integrate operations of modulation, multiplexing and switching using chip real estate almost as compact as those offered by electronics. These integrated optical technologies have yet to find widespread use in networks primarily because of problems of interconnecting them to electronics, optical fiber but more importantly in the case of data centers and supercomputers, finding a compelling need. For example, operations that are better performed optically in those data racks that are fiber optically linked together. In this work we are investigating compelling needs through modeling and experiment.

					<p>Shape-Memory Polymers (SMPs) have unique properties that allow them to alter their shape in response to specific stimuli. By bonding a pre-strained, thermally-responsive Shape Memory Polymer film to an elastomeric substrate of similar thickness, applying localized heat between the layers causes contraction of the SMP layer, and a bending motion of the entire bi-layer system. This project aims to study the relationship between the programming conditions of the SMP, substrate thickness, and bending curvature. Experimental results are compared to a theoretical, finite element model. This knowledge is then used to realize deployable structures through origami self-folding.

					<p>Most conventional medical stents were made from metal to keep vessel or urethra open, however, neointimal hyperplasia and smooth muscle cells accumulation are reported for bare metal stents, which leads to inflammation and turbulent blood flow. Another issue occurs when implanting the stent into the vessel. Doctors need to insert a balloon catheter into patient’s vessel during surgery, which may cause pain, damage to the tissue and even inflammation to the healthy part. Shape memory polymers (SMP), apart from the bio-inert property, offers more potentials to realize a smart and flexible bio-medical stent. In this research, we used SMP as the structure material for the stent and integrated sensors that at the same time detect the bio-condition. Currently we are working on mixing Nano-Ferro-Magnetic particles with our SMPs to achieve remotely controlling the moving of the stent and the place it fixed. Considering that we could always adjust the transition temperature by change the chemical ratio in our formula, it will be more promising to trigger the transition at a little higher than body temperature, and alternating magnetic field could adopt to heat up the stent.

Thus, I am seeking a student who can help design software interfaces for programmable knitting and weaving machines that will allow people to design and simulate various computational behaviors on fabrics. This will involve learning both about traditional fabric production techniques like weaving and knitting; learning about various "smart" materials that can be integrated into fabric; and developing deeper knowledge of electronics and circuitry.

					<p>Perceptual learning is the technique of showing many training instances to a human learner, usually in visual manner, and forcing the learner to make a prediction/label while providing feedback. When done appropriately, this can develop a gut instinct in the learner, which appears to be how many human experts operate (i.e., a chess master can glance at a chess board and quickly form a first impression about the strength of a position; a forester can glance at a far-off tree and guess the species).  There is some software to automate this, called perceptual learning modules (PLM), but these PLM require the user to input a training set of labeled images which is clearly very time consuming. This project would create a PLM website that uses google image search to automatically generate the training set, so that the user specifies only the labels (such as “pine tree” and “spruce tree”) and the website generates corresponding training images. Students must be comfortable with web programming (accessing data via API’s, and building dynamic webpages).

					<p>The concept of engineering identity is a big one for engineering education researchers to  understand. Consider: Do you feel like you’re an engineer? Do you identify with the profession of engineering? Do others officially recognize you as an engineer? To what consequence?  / Beginning in the Fall 2017 semester, we are starting several exciting initiatives to better understand how the structure, environment and culture of our first-year courses impact how students are feeling about being engineers.  / In this DLA, you will work with e+ faculty to identify a research question you’d like to investigate related to concepts of identity development in the first-year of engineering undergraduate. Together we’ll design a research strategy, explore relevant background literature, then collect data related to the research question, analyze the data, and see what we can learn based on the analysis. Along the way you will gain experience designing and executing an educational research study in engineering, with potential to develop and facilitate surveys, convene focus groups and conduct interviews with enrolled engineering students.

					<p>The goal of the ninja car project is to demonstrate on-board perception, planning and control algorithms for driving ground vehicles capable of dynamic “gymnastic moves” such as jumping, drifting, rolling, bouncing, tumbling or wall-driving. This capability for fast, lightweight autonomous ground vehicles is possible due to the confluence of innovative algorithms for perception, planning and control, as well as new actuators and small form factor computing. Our platform of choice is a small 1/8th scale off-road racing vehicle, modified with sensing, jump-actuation and on-board computing. Our goal is to reliably automate the execution of these dynamic, “gymnastic” maneuvers. We envision ninja cars launching off inclined surfaces, bouncing down walls, jumping through open windows, much like human parkour runners fly through urban spaces today. The question arises: where can such a novel class of vehicle actually drive? How much of the world is accessible to this class of vehicle? These platforms will be useful in a variety of contexts including cluttered terrain navigation, long-term surveillance, and high-speed pursuit using a variety of novel control maneuvers, such as jumping.

					<p>With an aging population research regarding cognitive, developmental and physical disabilities is becoming increasingly important.

The student would help to write up the research in journals so that other people with special needs have access to the research we have done.  The student will help to investigate technological research literature in this area or scientific community based learning literature.  I believe there is much to publish about the pedagogy of community based research.

					<p>The LAIR research group studies lightning through the radiated electromagnetic pulse (EMP). Lightning is the most powerful radiator on Earth, and its pulses can be detected around the globe. About 2% of the time, lightning is powerful enough that it lights up the ionosphere above at about 85 km altitude: the powerful EMP heats the lower ionosphere, causing it to glow for a fraction of a second. /  / An instrument known as PIPER was developed a few years ago to measure this glow, but PIPER is due for an upgrade. It needs to be faster, more compact, and more reliable. In this project, the student will re-design the PIPER instrument to quadruple the sampling rate, from 25,000 Samples/second to 100,000 S/s; re-design the analog and digital electronics; and rebuild the instrument enclosure. The student may then have the opportunity to run the instrument, collect data, and analyze it.  /  / Through this project the student will learn instrument and electronics design and development techniques, will be exposed to scientific instrumentation, and will learn about science data collection and analysis.

					<p>The purpose of this DLA project is to study the experiences and perceptions of individuals as they move from capstone courses into workplaces. It is increasingly important that we prepare our new engineering graduates to quickly and effectively contribute to the engineering workplace, and capstone design courses are central to this preparation. However, research highlights the differences between that which engineers do at work and the kinds of training they receive in school. Using a multi-case approach, this investigation seeks to understand how and to what extent capstone design courses prepare students to effectively enter communities of practice in engineering workplaces. The DLA student will meet weekly with faculty and be involved in collecting and analyzing data obtained through qualitative interviews and weekly reflective workplace surveys as well as selecting the cohort for the next year of the investigation. The anticipated findings include answers to research questions regarding preparation, developed skills, and important teaching practices that enable us to better understand how students move from capstone design courses into engineering workplaces. /  /

					<h4 align = "left">Description</h4>
					<p>The project proposes to introduce novel mechanisms to modulate and direct phonon propagation based on the new paradigm of topologically engineered energy transport in nanoscale materials. The proposed mechanism will not only enable to hinder phonon propagation in thermoelectric materials without introduction of additional scattering losses for electronic transport, furthermore, the concept will enhance our ability to create and manipulate ultra-long lived coherent phonon modes that have emerged as a crucial new resource in quantum information processing and sensing technologies.

					<h4 align = "left">Description</h4>
					<p>A novel polarization sensitive laser radar (lidar) has been under development for several years in my Active Remote Sensing Lab (ARSENL). This innovative system has led to a number of different applications, developments, and patents. To promote the lidar technique and my lab’s capability, there is a need to develop a lidar hardware/software demonstrator in the lab. The DLA project goal is to build a lidar bathymetry system in the lab that includes a mounting/scanning system over a water tank for observing submerged objects. There are several options for student participation from machining the mount system, constructing the lidar, to developing software for acquiring and displaying the lidar measurements. A DLA student with an interest in hands-on lab work (potential help with field work), system engineering, and remote sensing technologies is preferred.

					<h4 align = "left">Description</h4>
					<p>The ability to create and express oneself with technology is important for full participation in today’s digitally society. Many toys and kits have emerged for children to code or to create and express themselves with technology. However, these toys and kits often focus on children 8 years old and up. Toys that are available for young children to learn to code are often expensive or narrow in what can be done with them. In this project, we'll play-test existing toys to examine the space of what exists and imagine what's possible by developing new prototypes.

					<p>This project focuses on using a custom-built stereolithography system to manufacture 3D tissue engineering scaffolds. 3D printed biocompatible scaffolds can be used in applications ranging from three-dimensional cell culture for drug testing to personalized regenerative implants for tissue engineering. This work focuses on fabricating mechanically stiff constructs for cartilage tissue engineering and regeneration. Due to the relatively large physiological loads imparted on cartilage tissue, the mechanical properties of the constructs must be well understood, predictable, and applied in our 3D printing software design. The student working on this project will concentrate on the optimization and validation of novel material characterization models under the supervision of a materials science graduate student, for the development of 3D printing software that incorporates this model. The undergraduate on this project will gain experience with LabVIEW and Matlab by writing a software that predicts the parameters necessary for desired 3D printed construct properties. Additionally, the undergraduate will test the software by learning to fabricate complex constructs and learning to use mec
