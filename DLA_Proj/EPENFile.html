						<p>Our lab has recently begun to apply nanostructured device engineering to design and fabrication of acoustic systems such as loudspeakers and microphones. This project will develop aspects of these applications, including modeling and performance testing, and development of packaging opportunities and manufacturing, pushing towards fabrication of microphones that fit within 1 cubic millimeter.  One possible focus for this project is design for manufacturing and encapsulation of these devices. The technology to create these devices was developed in our lab and the mentor is excited to work with a student to bring it to the next phase of progress. The Discovery Learning Apprentice for this project will have the opportunity to learn methods for simulating microscale transducers, skills to accurately and precisely fabricate devices, and experience with microphone and loudspeaker characterization. Applicants should be: comfortable with working independently, self-motivated, and highly interested in MEMS and acoustics.

						<p>Optical Frequency Combs (OFCs) are a repetitive series of ultrashort laser pulses / spanning a broad bandwidth (i.e. many colors) with spectra that look like a series of / delta functions (i.e. comb teeth). Dual comb spectroscopy is a technique that uses two / OFC lasers of slightly different spacings to measure ultra­high resolution complex / spectra of a probed gas sample in the time domain using interference between the two / combs on a single detector and FFT based signal processing. Molecules have unique / absorption spectra in the Short Wave and Mid IR vibrational fingerprint region which allows / characterization of the composition and concentration of a gas sample through which / one of the OFCs propagates. A measured spectra must be fit to a library of known / molecular spectra by varying the strength (concentration) of each constituent.

						<p>This research aims to decipher the interplay between the microstructural length scales intrinsic to granular geomaterials and the wave transmission characteristics of such media over a wide frequency spectrum. In this spirit, the proposed developments are focused on examining the dispersion and attenuation of longitudinal (and flexural) waves in soil specimens of various composition. An experimental setup is proposed where a cylindrical sample of dried soil is held between a pair of source/receiver transducers under a prescribed static prestress. The (source) transducer is excited by a narrow-band modulated 5-cycle sine burst with carrier frequency fc and bandwidth 0.1fc. Thus-induced wave motion in soil is captured (a) by the (receiver) transducer, and (b) via either a high- speed camera (available in the Geotechnical Centrifuge Lab). The specimen is a periodic assembly of unit cells comprised of a certain composition of soil grains, which may be manufactured (a) by encasing the soil assembly in a plastic wrap of infinitesimal thickness, and (b) via sequential processing where (dry) soil particles are first assembled in a suitable container; the sample is then saturated (either by water or meta-cellulose) and subsequently oven-baked; thus-obtained (dried) column of soil retains its shape for the purpose of dynamical testing. A high-fidelity algorithm rooted in Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is then developed aiming to map the image sequences captured by the high-speed camera into the particle velocity distribution (in time and space) on the soil surface. A cross-correlation technique is invoked to determine the phase shift between the measured signals at multiple scan points, that is eventually used to estimate the phase velocity at a given carrier frequency fc. In this setting, the dispersion curves are constructed experimentally by repeating the measurements over a desired span of carrier frequencies fc. The results will be used to validate the outcome of the analytical and computational campaigns in progress parallel to the development of the experimental side. Interested students will experience hands-on experiments on wave phenomena, and learn advanced signal/image processing methods as universal data-processing tools. The fun part of this project is its very interdisciplinary nature.

						<p>This research project explores the future of textiles, the materials that make up clothes, drapery and upholstery. New methods for combining smart materials and conductive threads allow us to create textiles that can change color and shape in response to computational data. For instance, your shirt might change its pattern upon receiving and email or a stripe could travel between your shirt and the shirt of a nearby friend. A key challenge in developing new interactive behaviors for textiles is the lack of design software for creating and simulating different interactive behaviors. Thus, I am seeking a student who can help design software interfaces for programmable knitting and weaving machines that will allow people to design and simulate various computational behaviors on fabrics. This will involve learning both about traditional fabric production techniques like weaving and knitting; learning about various "smart" materials that can be integrated into fabric; and developing deeper knowledge of electronics and circuitry. This position will require both hands on construction of smart textiles as well as software work.  /  /

						<p>The Harvest Oil Platform is located about 10 km off the coast of central California near Vandenberg Air Force Base. The platform is anchored to the sea floor and sits in about 200 m of water near the western entrance to the Santa Barbara Channel. Conditions at Harvest are typical of the open ocean: wind waves and swell average about 2 m, though waves up to 10 m have been experienced during powerful winter storms. Harvest Platform serves as the prime calibration site for the NASA TOPEX/POSEIDON (19922005), Jason-1 (20012013), OSTM/Jason-2 (2008) and Jason-3 (2016) missions, and is an important international resource for the study of sea level from space. Harvest continues to serve a crucial role in validating data from precise spaceborne radar altimeter systems. The principal objectives of the proposed work are to preserve this vital long-term calibration record from Harvest, and to improve the skill with which the experiment can detect systematic errors in the altimeter measurement systems.  The DLA student will assist the calibration team at CU/CCAR and NASA JPL.

						<p>Concrete is the most utilized construction material in the world and the second-most consumed material on Earth after water. Consequently, its production, use, and disposal has global environmental consequences. For example, the manufacture of cement alone is responsible for 5-8% of global carbon dioxide emissions. In addition to neg, concrete sequesters non-trivial amounts of CO2 via carbonation  a chemical reaction between cement paste and CO2. This project will employ a previously validated model that predicts carbon sequestration potential of concrete and extend it to other concrete products, namely hemp-lime concrete (aka hempcrete), a novel insulation material for energy efficient buildings. The model will account for cement type and content, exposure, and time. The model will be used to investigate the effect of these factors and the influence of compressive strength and geometry, namely surface-area-to-volume (SA/V) ratio, on total carbon sequestration of hemp-lime concrete.

						<p>Photonic crystals created from periodically modulated dielectric materials are an increasingly important paradigm for the control of light at the nanoscale.  Our work seeks to utilize photonic crystals for coupling light to quantum emitters.  In order to utilize nanophotonic devices for our experiments it is imperative they can be placed in an ultrahigh vacuum environment where atomic quantum emitters can be well isolated.  There are many challenges associated with this task, including the optical coupling.  We are seeking to solve this challenge through a project involving optical design, testing and optimization.  A free-space optical laser beam will be coupled into an ultrahigh vacuum chamber, and the ability to efficiently couple into a device will be tested.

						<p>As electronic devices become thinner, thermal management is becoming a critical issue. And in the push for flexible electronics, traditional methods of heat removal are becoming more challenging. Our group is developing ultra thin, flexible thermal ground planes using microfabricated polymer heat pipes, as an enabling technology for future 1-mm thin smartphones. Major challenges associated with this project include hermetic sealing with atomic layer deposition (ALD) inorganic barrier films, design of flexible structures to enable a 90-degree bend without cracking, charging the microfluidic system to eliminate non-condensable gasses, and developing wicking structures with hydrophilic ALD films. Research tasks will be associated with the assembly, testing, and characterization of the thermal and fluid transport. This project will provide training in polymer device microfabrication and assembly, thermal and fluid structure characterization, and design of microsystems for thermal management.

Plant systems like algae are simple to study and provide great insights on the physical interactions leading to morphogenesis and help understand the process of growth.

						<p>The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) is a constellation of satellites operated by the United States Air Force.

These data are available at two institutions: the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) and the NASA OMNIweb data base. We are interested in joining the data bases from the institutions to estimate energy deposition into the upper atmosphere along the satellite track.  Of particular interest is the relative location of energy being deposited by fields alone (Poynting flux) and by particles alone. Most energy seems to be coming into the auroral zones, however some recent investigations suggest that significant energy is coming into the polar cap.

						<p>Optical fiber is the chosen medium for high data rate (Gbps) interconnections that are longer than circa 10 meters. Most recently, fiber has been applied to interconnecting the rack tops of warehouse scale data centers (WSCs). Fiber itself is only useful for point to point interconnections. Electronics distributes signals to optical modulators for multiplexing and from optical detectors for processing. Integrated optical technologies in semiconductors are becoming more sophisticated. Such technologies can be be used to integrate operations of modulation, multiplexing and switching using chip real estate almost as compact as those offered by electronics. These integrated optical technologies have yet to find widespread use in networks primarily because of problems of interconnecting them to electronics, optical fiber but more importantly in the case of data centers and supercomputers, finding a compelling need. For example, operations that are better performed optically in those data racks that are fiber optically linked together. In this work we are investigating compelling needs through modeling and experiment.

						<p>A novel polarization sensitive laser radar (lidar) has been under development for several years in my Active Remote Sensing Lab (ARSENL). This innovative system has led to a number of different applications, developments, and patents. To promote the lidar technique and my labs capability, there is a need to develop a lidar hardware/software demonstrator in the lab. The DLA project goal is to build a lidar bathymetry system in the lab that includes a mounting/scanning system over a water tank for observing submerged objects. There are several options for student participation from machining the mount system, constructing the lidar, to developing software for acquiring and displaying the lidar measurements. A DLA student with an interest in hands-on lab work (potential help with field work), system engineering, and remote sensing technologies is preferred.

						<p>This study will aim at understanding the visco-elastic behavior of a natural cellular hydrogel made of soft particles adhering to one-another via capillary forces. This study is of great interest to understand the behavior of self-healing materials and the response of elastomer liquid crystals to mechanical forces. We will use a simple, yet rich system made of hydrated chia seeds surrounded by a mucus layer providing adhesion forces.  This project will specifically focus on two main tasks: (a) Characterize the structure and properties of the (slimy) polymer surrounding chia seeds and measure the adhesion strength between two seeds and (b) Characterize the visco-elastic behavior and local deformation of the two-dimensional sheets of chia particles (with particle tracking algorithms). These experimental task will be complemented by theoretical prediction and numerical simulations performed by the graduate student mentor.  /

						<p>Micro-grids for Smart Villages is a collaboration of UCB faculty, the Mortenson Center for Engineering in Developing Communities (MC-EDC), The IEEE Smart Village Program (ISV) and LInstitut Technique de la Côte-Sud (ITCS), Coteaux, Sud-Ouest, Haiti. The Haitian electrical power distribution grid was accessible to only about 10\% of the population before the earthquake of January 2010. Much of that infrastructure was destroyed. Practically, the Haitian grid of the future will have to grow from localized green energy farms be they photovoltaic, micro/pico hydro and/or wind. This development will require the training of a Haitian green energy work force as well as fundamentally new knowledge about design of power grids that are fundamentally variable in output. A micro-grid developed in Sud-Ouest, Haiti was devastated during Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. We have recently installed a micro-grid at are partners (ITCS) training site in southwest Haiti. We will continue monitoring as well as expanding this micro-grid. Students working with the program will assist in green energy research while interfacing with students, practitioners and researchers in Haiti. /

						<p>This project uses computer simulations to optimize the location of groundwater monitoring wells to properly characterize the effectiveness of in situ remediation of contaminated groundwater.  During in situ groundwater remediation, a chemical or biological amendment is introduced into a contaminant plume to react with and degrade the contaminant.  The reactions occur at the contact area between the amendment and contaminant plumes.  We have developed a novel method that uses time-varying flow fields to increase the contact area and enhance degradation.  The effectiveness of the method has been demonstrated through computer simulations, which solve for concentrations of contaminant, amendment, and reaction product throughout the domain.  In a field setting, however, concentration data can only be collected at a finite number of wells, whose locations must be chosen strategically to maximize the amount of useful information available to evaluate the effectiveness of the method. The purpose of this project is to identify the set of optimal well locations that balances the tradeoff between maximizing the information obtained and minimizing cost.

						<p>With an aging population research regarding cognitive, developmental and physical disabilities is becoming increasingly important.

The student would help to write up the research in journals so that other people with special needs have access to the research we have done.  The student will help to investigate technological research literature in this area or scientific community based learning literature.

						<p>The purpose of this DLA project is to study the experiences and perceptions of individuals as they move from capstone courses into workplaces. It is increasingly important that we prepare our new engineering graduates to quickly and effectively contribute to the engineering workplace, and capstone design courses are central to this preparation. However, research highlights the differences between that which engineers do at work and the kinds of training they receive in school. Using a multi-case approach, this investigation seeks to understand how and to what extent capstone design courses prepare students to effectively enter communities of practice in engineering workplaces. The DLA student will meet weekly with faculty and be involved in collecting and analyzing data obtained through qualitative interviews and weekly reflective workplace surveys as well as selecting the cohort for the next year of the investigation. The anticipated findings include answers to research questions regarding preparation, developed skills, and important teaching practices that enable us to better understand how students move from capstone design courses into engineering workplaces. /  /

						<p>Antiferromagnets are materials where each molecule's spin is ordered so that neighboring spins point in opposite directions. Recently, antiferromagnets have been considered attractive materials for spintronics applications, i.e., those that use spin current rather than or in addition to charge current in circuitry. The Dispersive Hydrodynamics Laboratory (DHL) is investigating spin dynamics in magnetic materials utilizing a novel hydrodynamic formulation that DHL members recently derived for a class of ferromagnets.  This theory interprets spin dynamics in a solid state magnet as fluid dynamics for which spin-density waves and nonlinear structures such as magnetic vortices can be better understood. The student who pursues this project will extend the hydrodynamic partial differential equations to antiferromagnetic materials, building upon work by DHL group members. Special solutions known as uniform hydrodynamic states and spin-density waves will be derived. Their dynamic stability and associated dispersion relation shall be assessed.  Finally, the student will search for other nonlinear structures, such as solitons, dispersive shock waves, and vortices.

						<p>The engagement of the Mickelson group in applications of rural telecommunications (Nepal, Peru, Cameroon, Papua New Guinea (PNG)) is longstanding (a decade). The group has worked cooperatively with various Universities, NGOs, health entities, government entities and funding agencies (Venture, IEEE - Foundation, Humanitarian Activities Committee (HAC) and Smart Village (SV)) on health, education and commerce projects. The group is presently constructing a Wi-Fi Long Distance Testbed here in Boulder in order to pre-test wireless equipment before jungle/mountain installations far from home. New equipment for this highly innovative technology is constantly appearing as is simulation software. The group has also been testing innovative power supply solutions for the mainly solar powered Industry, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band installations. There is an option for students working with us here to who have interest in rural telecommunications to join us during assessment, installation and evaluation trips to distant locations.  /

						<p>Thin films and membranes are ubiquitous in nature and technology, with examples including mylar films used in solar sails, biological membranes, thin metallic coatings, and flexible electronics. When such structures are subjected to complex stress states, such as shear, compression or non-equibiaxial loading, they can form wrinkles and permanent creases, which in turn affect their mechanical response. In order to design structures using this thin elements, it is important to understand their response to non trivial loading. /  / This project will combine experiments with numerical and theoretical analysis, in order to explore the behavior of thin films and membranes. One of the main goals is the design and assembly of an experimental apparatus able to apply different biaxial loadings to thin membranes, in order to excite different states of stress in the material. The set-up will test different specimens, such as commercial films (mylar) and elastomeric membranes built by the student. /  / The work will be done in close collaboration with an incoming PhD student.
