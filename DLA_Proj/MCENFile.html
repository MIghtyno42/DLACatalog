					<p>In urban environments, infrastructure components are not isolated. Due to their close proximity, they interact with one another during earthquakes by affecting the static and dynamic stresses in the underlying interface soil. The research objective is to identify the key predictors of the performance of a building cluster on softened ground by: (1) performing centrifuge experiments to fundamentally evaluate multiple structure-soil-structure interaction on liquefiable ground and the impact and relative importance of the properties of building, ground motion, mitigation strategy, and cluster on the EDPs of structure and surrounding soil; (2) developing validated nonlinear numerical models of the coupled structure-soil-structure systems that are studied experimentally; and (3) performing a preliminary parametric study with the calibrated numerical models to define the most efficient ground motion predicting parameters of the performance of building clusters on softened ground. The undergraduate student involved in this project will be heavily involved in centrifuge modeling and data processing/visualization component of this research.

					<p>Space habitat environmental control uses multi-layer insulation and thermal shields to passively protect the habitat from both hot and cold external environments, then Active Thermal Control Systems keep the cabin temperature within the desired range. Typically, water cooling loops pick up heat from cold plates attached to the electronic equipment and experiments. The heated water then flows through interface heat exchangers to external coolant loops that then transport the heat to radiators, which in turn reject the heat to space. / Ground-based development of cooling loops, heat exchangers and radiators requires thermal vacuum chambers (TVACs) to simulate the space environment during experiments. An AES Bioastronautics Laboratory TVAC was designed to test integrated systems, but still needs work to complete the development and installation of the liquid nitrogen (LN2) cooling shroud. / A student on this project will rework and test a cylindrical LN2 shroud. Then, the student will design, build and test flat-plate LN2 shrouds for the chamber endcap and door. Once completed, the student will conduct tests to characterize the chamber environment with cooling provided by the LN2 shrouds.

					<p>When astronauts return to Earth from extended exposure to microgravity they experience substantial sensorimotor/neurovestibular deconditioning. This results in loss of balance, poor locomotion, degraded motor control, and errors in orientation perception. Specifically, when returning astronauts tilt their heads they often become very disoriented and perceive they are translating. To further investigate this phenomenon, we are developing a ground-based analog. We restrain subject’s head movements using a motorized wheelchair device to reproduce some of the similar motion patterns experienced in space. Experiments last up to 12 hours. Afterwards we measure balance, locomotion, and orientation perception using a battery of tests. We are working on then testing their perception of orientation and motion using a human-rated motion device that can tilt and translate. Responsibilities will include developing hardware and software for our wheelchair device and motion devices, testing them for safety, performing human subject experiments, and analyzing data.   /  /

An ideal countermeasure to recreate the loading using artificial gravity through centrifugation. A desired gravitational load can be created by a very large, slowly rotating centrifuge or far more practically a short radius centrifuge rotating a high speeds. However, faster rotation rates cause disorientation due to the vestibular cross-coupled illusion. We are studying how fast of rotation rates are tolerable to inform how large a centrifuge design must be. This is done by performing human subject experiments using our "Human Rotator Device".

					<p>Shape-Memory Polymers (SMPs) have unique properties that allow them to alter their shape in response to specific stimuli. By bonding a pre-strained, thermally-responsive Shape Memory Polymer film to an elastomeric substrate of similar thickness, applying localized heat between the layers causes contraction of the SMP layer, and a bending motion of the entire bi-layer system. This project aims to study the relationship between the programming conditions of the SMP, substrate thickness, and bending curvature. Experimental results are compared to a theoretical, finite element model. This knowledge is then used to realize deployable structures through origami self-folding.

					<p>Most conventional medical stents were made from metal to keep vessel or urethra open, however, neointimal hyperplasia and smooth muscle cells accumulation are reported for bare metal stents, which leads to inflammation and turbulent blood flow. Another issue occurs when implanting the stent into the vessel. Doctors need to insert a balloon catheter into patient’s vessel during surgery, which may cause pain, damage to the tissue and even inflammation to the healthy part. Shape memory polymers (SMP), apart from the bio-inert property, offers more potentials to realize a smart and flexible bio-medical stent. In this research, we used SMP as the structure material for the stent and integrated sensors that at the same time detect the bio-condition. Currently we are working on mixing Nano-Ferro-Magnetic particles with our SMPs to achieve remotely controlling the moving of the stent and the place it fixed. Considering that we could always adjust the transition temperature by change the chemical ratio in our formula, it will be more promising to trigger the transition at a little higher than body temperature, and alternating magnetic field could adopt to heat up the stent.

					<p>This research project explores the future of textiles, the materials that make up clothes, drapery and upholstery. New methods for combining smart materials and conductive threads allow us to create textiles that can change color and shape in response to computational data. For instance, your shirt might change its pattern upon receiving and email or a stripe could travel between your shirt and the shirt of a nearby friend. A key challenge in developing new interactive behaviors for textiles is the lack of design software for creating and simulating different interactive behaviors. Thus, I am seeking a student who can help design software interfaces for programmable knitting and weaving machines that will allow people to design and simulate various computational behaviors on fabrics. This will involve learning both about traditional fabric production techniques like weaving and knitting; learning about various "smart" materials that can be integrated into fabric; and developing deeper knowledge of electronics and circuitry. This position will require both hands on construction of smart textiles as well as software work.  /  /

					<p>The LAIR research group studies lightning and thunderstorms through their radiated electromagnetic pulse (EMP) and quasi-static electric fields on the ground. These static electric fields vary from 100 V/m in clear-sky conditions to a few kV/m during thunderstorms, and the magnitude of the field tells us a great deal about the charging and discharging within the thunderstorm.  /  / Electric fields are measured by an Electric Field Mill (EFM), which primarily consists of a fast, rotating plate that measures the charge induced by the electric field. Our group is working on designs for a low-cost system that is more reliable and equally sensitive.  /  / The LAIR group is planning to deploy about eight of these EFMs in Argentina in the Fall of 2018, but first we need to build them! The interested student can learn about thunderstorm electric fields and the design and operation of EFMs. The student will design and build the mechanical structure for the EFM, including interfacing with a motor, and must be waterproof and able to operate for months at a time. The student may also participate in the design and construction of the signal processing electronics and data acquisition systems.

					<p>The LAIR research group studies lightning through the radiated electromagnetic pulse (EMP). Lightning is the most powerful radiator on Earth, and its pulses can be detected around the globe. About 2% of the time, lightning is powerful enough that it lights up the ionosphere above at about 85 km altitude: the powerful EMP heats the lower ionosphere, causing it to glow for a fraction of a second. /  / An instrument known as PIPER was developed a few years ago to measure this glow, but PIPER is due for an upgrade. It needs to be faster, more compact, and more reliable. In this project, the student will re-design the PIPER instrument to quadruple the sampling rate, from 25,000 Samples/second to 100,000 S/s; re-design the analog and digital electronics; and rebuild the instrument enclosure. The student may then have the opportunity to run the instrument, collect data, and analyze it.  /  / Through this project the student will learn instrument and electronics design and development techniques, will be exposed to scientific instrumentation, and will learn about science data collection and analysis.

					<p>Concrete is the most utilized construction material in the world and the second-most consumed material on Earth after water. Consequently, its production, use, and disposal has global environmental consequences. For example, the manufacture of cement alone is responsible for 5-8% of global carbon dioxide emissions. In addition to neg, concrete sequesters non-trivial amounts of CO2 via carbonation – a chemical reaction between cement paste and CO2. This project will employ a previously validated model that predicts carbon sequestration potential of concrete and extend it to other concrete products, namely hemp-lime concrete (aka hempcrete), a novel insulation material for energy efficient buildings. The model will account for cement type and content, exposure, and time. The model will be used to investigate the effect of these factors and the influence of compressive strength and geometry, namely surface-area-to-volume (SA/V) ratio, on total carbon sequestration of hemp-lime concrete.

					<p>The purpose of this DLA project is to study the experiences and perceptions of individuals as they move from capstone courses into workplaces. It is increasingly important that we prepare our new engineering graduates to quickly and effectively contribute to the engineering workplace, and capstone design courses are central to this preparation. However, research highlights the differences between that which engineers do at work and the kinds of training they receive in school. Using a multi-case approach, this investigation seeks to understand how and to what extent capstone design courses prepare students to effectively enter communities of practice in engineering workplaces. The DLA student will meet weekly with faculty and be involved in collecting and analyzing data obtained through qualitative interviews and weekly reflective workplace surveys as well as selecting the cohort for the next year of the investigation. The anticipated findings include answers to research questions regarding preparation, developed skills, and important teaching practices that enable us to better understand how students move from capstone design courses into engineering workplaces. /  /

					<p>Living tissues are composed of cells that are complex systems using a combination of genetic and physical interactions during growth that result in morphogenesis (i.e. shape development). Understanding these mechanisms is critical in the design of bio-inspired programmable materials that reconfigure themselves in response to stimuli. Plant systems like algae are simple to study and provide great insights on the physical interactions leading to morphogenesis and help understand the process of growth. In this project, the student will closely work with a graduate student mentor to collect data from microscopic observations of the growth of a simple model: a green alga known as Coleochaete. The goal of this research will be to better understand how the mechanics of individual cell interactions govern macroscopic shape evolution of the alga. For this, experimental observations will be combined with computer simulations (performed by the graduate student) in order to identify the key parameters that control morphology changes and cell growth.  /

					<p>Current analysis systems suffer from a significant gap between the times and places data is collected and when and where it is analyzed. This project explores how people might take advantage of mobile technologies and augmented reality to bridge this gap. /  / Students on this project will develop web-based or Android-based applications for mobile data collection leveraging cloud storage and compute technologies. They will also design and and develop augmented reality applications and visualizations for analyzing collected data in context.  /  / Students should have prior programming experience. Experience with mobile development, databases, visualization, or augmented reality are a plus.

					<h4 align = "left">Description</h4>
					<p>A novel polarization sensitive laser radar (lidar) has been under development for several years in my Active Remote Sensing Lab (ARSENL). This innovative system has led to a number of different applications, developments, and patents. To promote the lidar technique and my lab’s capability, there is a need to develop a lidar hardware/software demonstrator in the lab. The DLA project goal is to build a lidar bathymetry system in the lab that includes a mounting/scanning system over a water tank for observing submerged objects. There are several options for student participation from machining the mount system, constructing the lidar, to developing software for acquiring and displaying the lidar measurements. A DLA student with an interest in hands-on lab work (potential help with field work), system engineering, and remote sensing technologies is preferred.
