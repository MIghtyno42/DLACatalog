					<p>The goal of the ninja car project is to demonstrate on-board perception, planning and control algorithms for driving ground vehicles capable of dynamic “gymnastic moves” such as jumping, drifting, rolling, bouncing, tumbling or wall-driving. This capability for fast, lightweight autonomous ground vehicles is possible due to the confluence of innovative algorithms for perception, planning and control, as well as new actuators and small form factor computing. Our platform of choice is a small 1/8th scale off-road racing vehicle, modified with sensing, jump-actuation and on-board computing. Our goal is to reliably automate the execution of these dynamic, “gymnastic” maneuvers. We envision ninja cars launching off inclined surfaces, bouncing down walls, jumping through open windows, much like human parkour runners fly through urban spaces today. The question arises: where can such a novel class of vehicle actually drive?  How much of the world is accessible to this class of vehicle? These platforms will be useful in a variety of contexts including cluttered terrain navigation, long-term surveillance, and high-speed pursuit using a variety of novel control maneuvers, such as jumping.

					<p>Micro-grids for Smart Villages is a collaboration of UCB faculty, the Mortenson Center for Engineering in Developing Communities (MC-EDC), The IEEE Smart Village Program (ISV) and L’Institut Technique de la Côte-Sud (ITCS), Coteaux, Sud-Ouest, Haiti. The Haitian electrical power distribution grid was accessible to only about 10\% of the population before the earthquake of January 2010. Much of that infrastructure was destroyed. Practically, the Haitian grid of the future will have to grow from localized green energy farms be they photovoltaic, micro/pico hydro and/or wind. This development will require the training of a Haitian green energy work force as well as fundamentally new knowledge about design of power grids that are fundamentally variable in output. A micro-grid developed in Sud-Ouest, Haiti was devastated during Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. We have recently installed a micro-grid at are partners (ITCS) training site in southwest Haiti. We will continue monitoring as well as expanding this micro-grid. Students working with the program will assist in green energy research while interfacing with students, practitioners and researchers in Haiti. /

					<p>The engagement of the Mickelson group in applications of rural telecommunications (Nepal, Peru, Cameroon, Papua New Guinea (PNG)) is longstanding (a decade). The group has worked cooperatively with various Universities, NGOs, health entities, government entities and funding agencies (Venture, IEEE - Foundation, Humanitarian Activities Committee (HAC) and Smart Village (SV)) on health, education and commerce projects. The group is presently constructing a Wi-Fi Long Distance Testbed here in Boulder in order to pre-test wireless equipment before jungle/mountain installations far from home. New equipment for this highly innovative technology is constantly appearing as is simulation software. The group has also been testing innovative power supply solutions for the mainly solar powered Industry, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band installations. There is an option for students working with us here to who have interest in rural telecommunications to join us during assessment, installation and evaluation trips to distant locations.  /

					<p>Optical fiber is the chosen medium for high data rate (Gbps) interconnections that are longer than circa 10 meters. Most recently, fiber has been applied to interconnecting the rack tops of warehouse scale data centers (WSC’s). Fiber itself is only useful for point to point interconnections. Electronics distributes signals to optical modulators for multiplexing and from optical detectors for processing. Integrated optical technologies in semiconductors are becoming more sophisticated. Such technologies can be be used to integrate operations of modulation, multiplexing and switching using chip real estate almost as compact as those offered by electronics. These integrated optical technologies have yet to find widespread use in networks primarily because of problems of interconnecting them to electronics, optical fiber but more importantly in the case of data centers and supercomputers, finding a compelling need. For example, operations that are better performed optically in those data racks that are fiber optically linked together. In this work we are investigating compelling needs through modeling and experiment.

					<p>In order to simulate instrument field of view, we would like to develop a virtual camera within the Basilisk framework (see http://hanspeterschaub.info/AVS-Basilisk.html for more info on this exciting astrodynamics framework being developed.. This will allow modeling of science instruments, and the implementation of Optical Navigation methods. The DLA student would be assist us in the development of this virtual camera with a 3D environment, by interfacing between the Basilisk visualization and the separate Basilisk satellite dynamics model. The goal will be to give a modular, modifiable camera model, opening many research paths.

					<h4 align = "left">Description</h4>
					<p>This project is focused on organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) as a biosensing platform. OECTs are used in applications ranging from measurements of epileptic activity and neuron action potentials to measurements of metabolic activity in cancerous cells. Our work is focused on the device physics and materials science of OECTs and the development of faster transistors with higher signal-to-noise ratios. Undergraduate work on this project will primarily be the optimization of novel methods for patterning organic materials. The undergraduate on this project will learn to fabricate OECTs using microfabrication techniques including photolithography, metal deposition, and reactive ion etching. Additionally, the undergraduate will learn to use characterization tools such as source-meter-units for electrical testing and contact profilometers for measurement of device dimensions and surface quality.

					<p>Crewed space exploration missions will involve humans (astronauts) interacting with complex, automated systems. For example, during future crewed planetary landings (e.g. on the moon or Mars) astronauts will be required to supervise automated landing programs and intervene by transitioning to a pilot manual control mode, if necessary. In this project we will develop advanced display concepts and novel control modes to enhance the astronaut pilot landing performance and safety. We will then test their effectiveness by performing human subject experiments in our spacecraft cockpit simulator. We measure human responses, such as workload and situational awareness, as well a overall system performance. Responsibilities will include developing software for experiments (particularly MATLAB and Simulink), performing human subject testing, and analyzing data.
