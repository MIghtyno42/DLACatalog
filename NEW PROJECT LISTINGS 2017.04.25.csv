In this spirit, the proposed developments are focused on examining the dispersion and attenuation of longitudinal (and flexural) waves in soil specimens of various composition. An experimental setup is proposed where a cylindrical sample of dried soil is held between a pair of source/receiver transducers under a prescribed static prestress. The (source) transducer is excited by a narrow-band modulated 5-cycle sine burst with carrier frequency fc and bandwidth 0.1fc. Thus-induced wave motion in soil is captured (a) by the (receiver) transducer, and (b) via either a high- speed camera (available in the Geotechnical Centrifuge Lab). The specimen is a periodic assembly of unit cells comprised of a certain composition of soil grains, which may be manufactured (a) by encasing the soil assembly in a plastic wrap of infinitesimal thickness, and (b) via sequential processing where (dry) soil particles are first assembled in a suitable container; the sample is then saturated (either by water or meta-cellulose) and subsequently oven-baked; thus-obtained (dried) column of soil retains its shape for the purpose of dynamical testing. A high-fidelity algorithm rooted in Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is then developed aiming to map the image sequences captured by the high-speed camera into the particle velocity distribution (in time and space) on the soil surface. A cross-correlation technique is invoked to determine the phase shift between the measured signals at multiple scan points, that is eventually used to estimate the phase velocity at a given carrier frequency fc. In this setting, the dispersion curves are constructed experimentally by repeating the measurements over a desired span of carrier frequencies fc. The results will be used to validate the outcome of the analytical and computational campaigns in progress parallel to the development of the experimental side. Interested students will experience hands-on experiments on wave phenomena, and learn advanced signal/image processing methods as universal data-processing tools.

New methods for combining smart materials and conductive threads allow us to create textiles that can change color and shape in response to computational data. For instance, your shirt might change its pattern upon receiving and email or a stripe could travel between your shirt and the shirt of a nearby friend. A key challenge in developing new interactive behaviors for textiles is the lack of design software for creating and simulating different interactive behaviors. Thus, I am seeking a student who can help design software interfaces for programmable knitting and weaving machines that will allow people to design and simulate various computational behaviors on fabrics. This will involve learning both about traditional fabric production techniques like weaving and knitting; learning about various ""smart"" materials that can be integrated into fabric; and developing deeper knowledge of electronics and circuitry. This position will require both hands on construction of smart textiles as well as software work.  /  / ","The ideal student will have an interest in craft as well as computation, experience with computer graphics and/or the creation of user interfaces, and experience building circuits and programming microcontrollers like the Arduino.

There are several FDA approved protein therapeutics available, however, the delicate nature of proteins means that even small mechanical shocks to the vial (e.g., dropping a vial onto ground, shipping and handling of vials) can cause bubbles to nucleate, grow, then collapse, which is known as cavitation.  Cavitation has been shown to (1) denature the protein thereby lessening its therapeutic effectiveness, and (2) cause the protein to aggregate which can elicit an immune response from the patient.  To mitigate these effects, we are working to create surfaces which can resist protein adsorption and simultaneously increase the mechanical energy threshold before cavitation occurs.  There are two main approaches that we will employ: (1) patterning of the surfaces using sol-gel chemistry, and (2) functionalization of surfaces using silane and amine chemistries.

This capability for fast, lightweight autonomous ground vehicles is possible due to the confluence of innovative algorithms for perception, planning and control, as well as new actuators and small form factor computing. Our platform of choice is a small 1/8th scale off-road racing vehicle, modified with sensing, jump-actuation and on-board computing. Our goal is to reliably automate the execution of these dynamic, “gymnastic” maneuvers.

The reactions occur at the contact area between the amendment and contaminant plumes.  We have developed a novel method that uses time-varying flow fields to increase the contact area and enhance degradation.  The effectiveness of the method has been demonstrated through computer simulations, which solve for concentrations of contaminant, amendment, and reaction product throughout the domain.  In a field setting, however, concentration data can only be collected at a finite number of wells, whose locations must be chosen strategically to maximize the amount of useful information available to evaluate the effectiveness of the method.

Within a moderate flow regime, known as the transcritical regime, the flow profile becomes unsteady, yielding the generation of propagating nonlinear waves.  In this project, the student will investigate the two-dimensional, standing wave analogy to this phenomenon in which spatial variation in one direction behaves similar to the temporal variation in the aforementioned dynamic problem.  Both experiments and mathematics will be developed to study this problem.  Of particular interest is the role of surface tension at fluid depths of about 5mm where the water wave dispersion curvature changes sign.  It has recently been shown that hydrodynamic flows with non-convex dispersion can yield new, non-classical, nonlinear wave structures.  The aim of this project is to generate and mathematically model non-classical dispersive shock waves and solitons.
