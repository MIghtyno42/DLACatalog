					<p>Micro-grids for Smart Villages is a collaboration of UCB faculty, the Mortenson Center for Engineering in Developing Communities (MC-EDC), The IEEE Smart Village Program (ISV) and L’Institut Technique de la Côte-Sud (ITCS), Coteaux, Sud-Ouest, Haiti. The Haitian electrical power distribution grid was accessible to only about 10\% of the population before the earthquake of January 2010. Much of that infrastructure was destroyed. Practically, the Haitian grid of the future will have to grow from localized green energy farms be they photovoltaic, micro/pico hydro and/or wind. This development will require the training of a Haitian green energy work force as well as fundamentally new knowledge about design of power grids that are fundamentally variable in output. A micro-grid developed in Sud-Ouest, Haiti was devastated during Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. We have recently installed a micro-grid at are partners (ITCS) training site in southwest Haiti. We will continue monitoring as well as expanding this micro-grid. Students working with the program will assist in green energy research while interfacing with students, practitioners and researchers in Haiti. /

					<p>The engagement of the Mickelson group in applications of rural telecommunications (Nepal, Peru, Cameroon, Papua New Guinea (PNG)) is longstanding (a decade). The group has worked cooperatively with various Universities, NGOs, health entities, government entities and funding agencies (Venture, IEEE - Foundation, Humanitarian Activities Committee (HAC) and Smart Village (SV)) on health, education and commerce projects. The group is presently constructing a Wi-Fi Long Distance Testbed here in Boulder in order to pre-test wireless equipment before jungle/mountain installations far from home. New equipment for this highly innovative technology is constantly appearing as is simulation software. The group has also been testing innovative power supply solutions for the mainly solar powered Industry, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band installations. There is an option for students working with us here to who have interest in rural telecommunications to join us during assessment, installation and evaluation trips to distant locations.  /

					<p>Sustainable sanitation systems require the functional integration of infrastructure and society; however, most studies focus on technology innovation and do not adequately account for how human behavior and social needs affect, and are affected by, sanitation systems. In resource-limited communities, sanitation systems continue to experience high failure rates. To address this gap, this research aims to elucidate the community processes (community priorities, stakeholder engagement processes, and training processes) and infrastructure designs that result in sustainable sanitation systems. Data collected from 20 communities in India will be used in the analysis. We will analyze how combined community processes and infrastructure designs affect the sustainability of sanitation and integrated sanitation and resource recovery systems using Qualitative Comparative Analysis. We will develop metrics to  evaluate the social, behavioral, and environmental impacts of sanitation and resource recovery systems in a life cycle analysis. Responsibilities will include coding and analyzing qualitative interview data, literature review, and assisting with conference and journal article authorship. /

					<p>Shape-Memory Polymers (SMPs) have unique properties that allow them to alter their shape in response to specific stimuli. By bonding a pre-strained, thermally-responsive Shape Memory Polymer film to an elastomeric substrate of similar thickness, applying localized heat between the layers causes contraction of the SMP layer, and a bending motion of the entire bi-layer system. This project aims to study the relationship between the programming conditions of the SMP, substrate thickness, and bending curvature. Experimental results are compared to a theoretical, finite element model. This knowledge is then used to realize deployable structures through origami self-folding.

					<p>Most conventional medical stents were made from metal to keep vessel or urethra open, however, neointimal hyperplasia and smooth muscle cells accumulation are reported for bare metal stents, which leads to inflammation and turbulent blood flow. Another issue occurs when implanting the stent into the vessel. Doctors need to insert a balloon catheter into patient’s vessel during surgery, which may cause pain, damage to the tissue and even inflammation to the healthy part. Shape memory polymers (SMP), apart from the bio-inert property, offers more potentials to realize a smart and flexible bio-medical stent. In this research, we used SMP as the structure material for the stent and integrated sensors that at the same time detect the bio-condition. Currently we are working on mixing Nano-Ferro-Magnetic particles with our SMPs to achieve remotely controlling the moving of the stent and the place it fixed. Considering that we could always adjust the transition temperature by change the chemical ratio in our formula, it will be more promising to trigger the transition at a little higher than body temperature, and alternating magnetic field could adopt to heat up the stent.

					<p>This research project explores the future of textiles, the materials that make up clothes, drapery and upholstery. New methods for combining smart materials and conductive threads allow us to create textiles that can change color and shape in response to computational data. For instance, your shirt might change its pattern upon receiving and email or a stripe could travel between your shirt and the shirt of a nearby friend. A key challenge in developing new interactive behaviors for textiles is the lack of design software for creating and simulating different interactive behaviors. Thus, I am seeking a student who can help design software interfaces for programmable knitting and weaving machines that will allow people to design and simulate various computational behaviors on fabrics. This will involve learning both about traditional fabric production techniques like weaving and knitting; learning about various "smart" materials that can be integrated into fabric; and developing deeper knowledge of electronics and circuitry. This position will require both hands on construction of smart textiles as well as software work.  /  /

					<p>Protecting therapeutic protein solutions is an important engineering problem. There are several FDA approved protein therapeutics available, however, the delicate nature of proteins means that even small mechanical shocks to the vial (e.g., dropping a vial onto ground, shipping and handling of vials) can cause bubbles to nucleate, grow, then collapse, which is known as cavitation.  Cavitation has been shown to (1) denature the protein thereby lessening its therapeutic effectiveness, and (2) cause the protein to aggregate which can elicit an immune response from the patient.  To mitigate these effects, we are working to create surfaces which can resist protein adsorption and simultaneously increase the mechanical energy threshold before cavitation occurs.  There are two main approaches that we will employ: (1) patterning of the surfaces using sol-gel chemistry, and (2) functionalization of surfaces using silane and amine chemistries.  By modifying the surfaces in these ways, we hope to create surfaces and, subsequently, vials which can adequately protect the proteins contained inside.

					<p>The purpose of this DLA project is to study the experiences and perceptions of individuals as they move from capstone courses into workplaces. It is increasingly important that we prepare our new engineering graduates to quickly and effectively contribute to the engineering workplace, and capstone design courses are central to this preparation. However, research highlights the differences between that which engineers do at work and the kinds of training they receive in school. Using a multi-case approach, this investigation seeks to understand how and to what extent capstone design courses prepare students to effectively enter communities of practice in engineering workplaces. The DLA student will meet weekly with faculty and be involved in collecting and analyzing data obtained through qualitative interviews and weekly reflective workplace surveys as well as selecting the cohort for the next year of the investigation. The anticipated findings include answers to research questions regarding preparation, developed skills, and important teaching practices that enable us to better understand how students move from capstone design courses into engineering workplaces. /  /

					<p>Living tissues are composed of cells that are complex systems using a combination of genetic and physical interactions during growth that result in morphogenesis (i.e. shape development). Understanding these mechanisms is critical in the design of bio-inspired programmable materials that reconfigure themselves in response to stimuli. Plant systems like algae are simple to study and provide great insights on the physical interactions leading to morphogenesis and help understand the process of growth. In this project, the student will closely work with a graduate student mentor to collect data from microscopic observations of the growth of a simple model: a green alga known as Coleochaete. The goal of this research will be to better understand how the mechanics of individual cell interactions govern macroscopic shape evolution of the alga. For this, experimental observations will be combined with computer simulations (performed by the graduate student) in order to identify the key parameters that control morphology changes and cell growth.  /

					<h4 align = "left">Description</h4>
					<p>This study will aim at understanding the visco-elastic behavior of a natural cellular hydrogel made of soft particles adhering to one-another via capillary forces. This study is of great interest to understand the behavior of self-healing materials and the response of elastomer liquid crystals to mechanical forces. We will use a simple, yet rich system made of hydrated chia seeds surrounded by a mucus layer providing adhesion forces.  This project will specifically focus on two main tasks: (a) Characterize the structure and properties of the (slimy) polymer surrounding chia seeds and measure the adhesion strength between two seeds and (b) Characterize the visco-elastic behavior and local deformation of the two-dimensional sheets of chia particles (with particle tracking algorithms). These experimental task will be complemented by theoretical prediction and numerical simulations performed by the graduate student mentor.  /

					<p>Media fandom has a long history in online spaces. Potential directions for this project include looking at online community migration (e.g., Usenet to Livejournal to Tumblr), negotiation of multiple identities online, and/or practices around online content creation such as fan fiction and remix videos. Interested students need only have an interest in this subject matter; there is the potential for both qualitative and quantitative/computational methods.

					<p>The student, in close collaboration with Prof. Greg Rieker and PhD student Amanda Makowiecki, will design and fabricate an experimental setup to study rates of wildfire spread in different materials.  The project will begin by studying the current state-of-the-art for facilities with similar objectives from other institutions.  From these studies, the student will propose a design for a wildfire spread facility at the University of Colorado.  Upon approval of the design, the student will aid in the fabrication, testing, and operation of the facility.

					<p>Investigation of energy conversion and storage in Lithium-ion batteries is fundamental to a broad range of applications encompassing electric vehicles, portable electronic devices and power tools. The energy transport process in these cells is a highly coupled, multiphysics phenomena and requires systematic investigation to understand the interactions between thermal, electrical and electrochemical phenomena. The project aims to investigate the thermal contact resistance at the cathode-separator interface and predict rational choice of separator materials to optimize battery performance.

					<p>The project proposes to introduce novel mechanisms to modulate and direct phonon propagation based on the new paradigm of topologically engineered energy transport in nanoscale materials. The proposed mechanism will not only enable to hinder phonon propagation in thermoelectric materials without introduction of additional scattering losses for electronic transport, furthermore, the concept will enhance our ability to create and manipulate ultra-long lived coherent phonon modes that have emerged as a crucial new resource in quantum information processing and sensing technologies.
