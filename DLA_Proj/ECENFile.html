						<li>In urban environments, infrastructure components are not isolated. Due to their close proximity, they interact with one another during earthquakes by affecting the static and dynamic stresses in the underlying interface soil. The research objective is to identify the key predictors of the performance of a building cluster on softened ground by: (1) performing centrifuge experiments to fundamentally evaluate multiple structure-soil-structure interaction on liquefiable ground and the impact and relative importance of the properties of building, ground motion, mitigation strategy, and cluster on the EDPs of structure and surrounding soil; (2) developing validated nonlinear numerical models of the coupled structure-soil-structure systems that are studied experimentally; and (3) performing a preliminary parametric study with the calibrated numerical models to define the most efficient ground motion predicting parameters of the performance of building clusters on softened ground. The undergraduate student involved in this project will be heavily involved in centrifuge modeling and data processing/visualization component of this research.

						<li>The goal of the ninja car project is to demonstrate on-board perception, planning and control algorithms for driving ground vehicles capable of dynamic ?gymnastic moves? such as jumping, drifting, rolling, bouncing, tumbling or wall-driving. This capability for fast, lightweight autonomous ground vehicles is possible due to the confluence of innovative algorithms for perception, planning and control, as well as new actuators and small form factor computing. Our platform of choice is a small 1/8th scale off-road racing vehicle, modified with sensing, jump-actuation and on-board computing. Our goal is to reliably automate the execution of these dynamic, ?gymnastic? maneuvers. We envision ninja cars launching off inclined surfaces, bouncing down walls, jumping through open windows, much like human parkour runners fly through urban spaces today. The question arises: where can such a novel class of vehicle actually drive?  How much of the world is accessible to this class of vehicle? These platforms will be useful in a variety of contexts including cluttered terrain navigation, long-term surveillance, and high-speed pursuit using a variety of novel control maneuvers, such as jumping.

The Haitian electrical power distribution grid was accessible to only about 10\% of the population before the earthquake of January 2010. Much of that infrastructure was destroyed. Practically, the Haitian grid of the future will have to grow from localized green energy farms be they photovoltaic, micro/pico hydro and/or wind. This development will require the training of a Haitian green energy work force as well as fundamentally new knowledge about design of power grids that are fundamentally variable in output. A micro-grid developed in Sud-Ouest, Haiti was devastated during Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. We have recently installed a micro-grid at are partners (ITCS) training site in southwest Haiti. We will continue monitoring as well as expanding this micro-grid. Students working with the program will assist in green energy research while interfacing with students, practitioners and researchers in Haiti. /

						<li>Optical fiber is the chosen medium for high data rate (Gbps) interconnections that are longer than circa 10 meters. Most recently, fiber has been applied to interconnecting the rack tops of warehouse scale data centers (WSC?s). Fiber itself is only useful for point to point interconnections. Electronics distributes signals to optical modulators for multiplexing and from optical detectors for processing. Integrated optical technologies in semiconductors are becoming more sophisticated. Such technologies can be be used to integrate operations of modulation, multiplexing and switching using chip real estate almost as compact as those offered by electronics. These integrated optical technologies have yet to find widespread use in networks primarily because of problems of interconnecting them to electronics, optical fiber but more importantly in the case of data centers and supercomputers, finding a compelling need. For example, operations that are better performed optically in those data racks that are fiber optically linked together. In this work we are investigating compelling needs through modeling and experiment.

						<li>Shape-Memory Polymers (SMPs) have unique properties that allow them to alter their shape in response to specific stimuli. By bonding a pre-strained, thermally-responsive Shape Memory Polymer film to an elastomeric substrate of similar thickness, applying localized heat between the layers causes contraction of the SMP layer, and a bending motion of the entire bi-layer system. This project aims to study the relationship between the programming conditions of the SMP, substrate thickness, and bending curvature. Experimental results are compared to a theoretical, finite element model. This knowledge is then used to realize deployable structures through origami self-folding.

						<li>Most conventional medical stents were made from metal to keep vessel or urethra open, however, neointimal hyperplasia and smooth muscle cells accumulation are reported for bare metal stents, which leads to inflammation and turbulent blood flow. Another issue occurs when implanting the stent into the vessel. Doctors need to insert a balloon catheter into patient?s vessel during surgery, which may cause pain, damage to the tissue and even inflammation to the healthy part. Shape memory polymers (SMP), apart from the bio-inert property, offers more potentials to realize a smart and flexible bio-medical stent. In this research, we used SMP as the structure material for the stent and integrated sensors that at the same time detect the bio-condition. Currently we are working on mixing Nano-Ferro-Magnetic particles with our SMPs to achieve remotely controlling the moving of the stent and the place it fixed. Considering that we could always adjust the transition temperature by change the chemical ratio in our formula, it will be more promising to trigger the transition at a little higher than body temperature, and alternating magnetic field could adopt to heat up the stent.

						<li>Perceptual learning is the technique of showing many training instances to a human learner, usually in visual manner, and forcing the learner to make a prediction/label while providing feedback. When done appropriately, this can develop a gut instinct in the learner, which appears to be how many human experts operate (i.e., a chess master can glance at a chess board and quickly form a first impression about the strength of a position; a forester can glance at a far-off tree and guess the species).  There is some software to automate this, called perceptual learning modules (PLM), but these PLM require the user to input a training set of labeled images which is clearly very time consuming. This project would create a PLM website that uses google image search to automatically generate the training set, so that the user specifies only the labels (such as ?pine tree? and ?spruce tree?) and the website generates corresponding training images. Students must be comfortable with web programming (accessing data via API?s, and building dynamic webpages).

						<li>The goal of the ninja car project is to demonstrate on-board perception, planning and control algorithms for driving ground vehicles capable of dynamic ?gymnastic moves? such as jumping, drifting, rolling, bouncing, tumbling or wall-driving. This capability for fast, lightweight autonomous ground vehicles is possible due to the confluence of innovative algorithms for perception, planning and control, as well as new actuators and small form factor computing. Our platform of choice is a small 1/8th scale off-road racing vehicle, modified with sensing, jump-actuation and on-board computing. Our goal is to reliably automate the execution of these dynamic, ?gymnastic? maneuvers. We envision ninja cars launching off inclined surfaces, bouncing down walls, jumping through open windows, much like human parkour runners fly through urban spaces today. The question arises: where can such a novel class of vehicle actually drive? How much of the world is accessible to this class of vehicle? These platforms will be useful in a variety of contexts including cluttered terrain navigation, long-term surveillance, and high-speed pursuit using a variety of novel control maneuvers, such as jumping.

It is increasingly important that we prepare our new engineering graduates to quickly and effectively contribute to the engineering workplace, and capstone design courses are central to this preparation. However, research highlights the differences between that which engineers do at work and the kinds of training they receive in school. Using a multi-case approach, this investigation seeks to understand how and to what extent capstone design courses prepare students to effectively enter communities of practice in engineering workplaces. The DLA student will meet weekly with faculty and be involved in collecting and analyzing data obtained through qualitative interviews and weekly reflective workplace surveys as well as selecting the cohort for the next year of the investigation.

This innovative system has led to a number of different applications, developments, and patents. To promote the lidar technique and my lab?s capability, there is a need to develop a lidar hardware/software demonstrator in the lab. The DLA project goal is to build a lidar bathymetry system in the lab that includes a mounting/scanning system over a water tank for observing submerged objects. There are several options for student participation from machining the mount system, constructing the lidar, to developing software for acquiring and displaying the lidar measurements.

						<li>U-factor is referred as the overall heat transfer coefficient. When quantifying the energy efficiency of a window assembly, U-factor can be used to express the rate of loss of non-solar heat.  The objective of this project is to design, manufacture and conduct multiple experimental tests to determine the U-factor of single-pane window. During this process, suggestions will be made to improve the insulation performance of single pane window, along with new AIRFilm super-insulation.  /  / We will design of a hot box apparatus to determine the steady state thermal performance of windows when exposed to controlled laboratory conditions. Major components of a hot box apparatus contain: 1) a metering box (simulating interior temperature) on one side of the window specimen; 2) a controlled guard box surrounding the metering box; 3) a climate chamber box (simulating exterior temperature) on the other side; 4) the specimen frame providing specimen support & insulation. / he envisioned work include: 1). Design of a prototype, 2). Experimental characterization of  the prototype performance, and 3). Periodically report the progress in a timely manner  /

						<li>All matters with a temperature higher than absolute 0 K emits thermal radiation. The atmospheric transmission window allows radiation at specific wavelength range (e.g. 8-14 æm) pass directly to the Universe without intermediate absorption and re-emission. This ?free? cooling by infrared radiation to the Universe could enable an infinite-size low-temperature reservoir, which could help on addressing global energy and environmental challenges.  / We have developed a 1-KW sized Radiative Cooled-Cold Storage  (RadiCold) System, made of 8 modules. Each RadiCold module has 4? ? 4? surface area. The objective of the project is to conduct multiple experimental tests to find out the performance of RadiCold modules and system under varying operating conditions (e.g. temperatures, clouds, condensation).  / Specific research tasks include: 1). Experimental testing of the RadiCold module and system performance; 2). Making suggestions on further improvements of the RadiCold module and system; 3). Investigating possible applications of the prototype RadiCold system; 4). Reporting progress on a weekly basis  /  /

						<li>Silicon-germanium interfaces are one of the most widely studied interfaces due to their potential applications as thermoelectric materials in several energy conversion devices (e.g., multi-mission radioisotope generators in space missions). While several studies have addressed these systems, a clear understanding regarding the precise role of interfaces in nanostructured Si-Ge materials is not yet available. As interfaces control the functionalities of nanomaterials, to tailor the thermoelectric efficiency of Si-Ge applications, the role of various point defects at the interfaces, and how they influence the energy transport properties is crucial. Overall, the project aims towards designing next-generation thermoelectric materials.

						<li>Optical Frequency Combs (OFCs) are a repetitive series of ultrashort laser pulses / spanning a broad bandwidth (i.e. many colors) with spectra that look like a series of / delta functions (i.e. comb teeth).
