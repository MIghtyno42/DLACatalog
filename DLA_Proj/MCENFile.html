						<p>When astronauts return to Earth from extended exposure to microgravity they experience substantial sensorimotor/neurovestibular deconditioning. This results in loss of balance, poor locomotion, degraded motor control, and errors in orientation perception. Specifically, when returning astronauts tilt their heads they often become very disoriented and perceive they are translating. To further investigate this phenomenon, we are developing a ground-based analog. We restrain subject’s head movements using a motorized wheelchair device to reproduce some of the similar motion patterns experienced in space. Experiments last up to 12 hours. Afterwards we measure balance, locomotion, and orientation perception using a battery of tests. We are working on then testing their perception of orientation and motion using a human-rated motion device that can tilt and translate. Responsibilities will include developing hardware and software for our wheelchair device and motion devices, testing them for safety, performing human subject experiments, and analyzing data.   /  /

						<p>Our lab has recently begun to apply nanostructured device engineering to design and fabrication of acoustic systems such as loudspeakers and microphones. This project will develop aspects of these applications, including modeling and performance testing, and development of packaging opportunities and manufacturing, pushing towards fabrication of microphones that fit within 1 cubic millimeter.  One possible focus for this project is design for manufacturing and encapsulation of these devices. The technology to create these devices was developed in our lab and the mentor is excited to work with a student to bring it to the next phase of progress. The Discovery Learning Apprentice for this project will have the opportunity to learn methods for simulating microscale transducers, skills to accurately and precisely fabricate devices, and experience with microphone and loudspeaker characterization. Applicants should be: comfortable with working independently, self-motivated, and highly interested in MEMS and acoustics.

						<p>This research aims to decipher the interplay between the microstructural length scales intrinsic to granular geomaterials and the wave transmission characteristics of such media over a wide frequency spectrum. In this spirit, the proposed developments are focused on examining the dispersion and attenuation of longitudinal (and flexural) waves in soil specimens of various composition. An experimental setup is proposed where a cylindrical sample of dried soil is held between a pair of source/receiver transducers under a prescribed static prestress. The (source) transducer is excited by a narrow-band modulated 5-cycle sine burst with carrier frequency fc and bandwidth 0.1fc. Thus-induced wave motion in soil is captured (a) by the (receiver) transducer, and (b) via either a high- speed camera (available in the Geotechnical Centrifuge Lab). The specimen is a periodic assembly of unit cells comprised of a certain composition of soil grains, which may be manufactured (a) by encasing the soil assembly in a plastic wrap of infinitesimal thickness, and (b) via sequential processing where (dry) soil particles are first assembled in a suitable container; the sample is then saturated (either by water or meta-cellulose) and subsequently oven-baked; thus-obtained (dried) column of soil retains its shape for the purpose of dynamical testing. A high-fidelity algorithm rooted in Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is then developed aiming to map the image sequences captured by the high-speed camera into the particle velocity distribution (in time and space) on the soil surface. A cross-correlation technique is invoked to determine the phase shift between the measured signals at multiple scan points, that is eventually used to estimate the phase velocity at a given carrier frequency fc. In this setting, the dispersion curves are constructed experimentally by repeating the measurements over a desired span of carrier frequencies fc. The results will be used to validate the outcome of the analytical and computational campaigns in progress parallel to the development of the experimental side. Interested students will experience hands-on experiments on wave phenomena, and learn advanced signal/image processing methods as universal data-processing tools. The fun part of this project is its very interdisciplinary nature.

						<p>In space exploration missions, when exposure to microgravity astronauts experience physiological deconditioning (e.g. bone and muscle loss, cardiovascular deconditioning, sensorimotor impairment, visual changes, etc.). An ideal countermeasure to recreate the loading using artificial gravity through centrifugation. A desired gravitational load can be created by a very large, slowly rotating centrifuge or far more practically a short radius centrifuge rotating a high speeds. However, faster rotation rates cause disorientation due to the vestibular cross-coupled illusion. We are studying how fast of rotation rates are tolerable to inform how large a centrifuge design must be. This is done by performing human subject experiments using our "Human Rotator Device". Responsibilities will include developing hardware and software for our motion devices, testing them for safety, performing human subject experiments, and analyzing data.

						<p>This research project explores the future of textiles, the materials that make up clothes, drapery and upholstery. New methods for combining smart materials and conductive threads allow us to create textiles that can change color and shape in response to computational data. For instance, your shirt might change its pattern upon receiving and email or a stripe could travel between your shirt and the shirt of a nearby friend. A key challenge in developing new interactive behaviors for textiles is the lack of design software for creating and simulating different interactive behaviors. Thus, I am seeking a student who can help design software interfaces for programmable knitting and weaving machines that will allow people to design and simulate various computational behaviors on fabrics. This will involve learning both about traditional fabric production techniques like weaving and knitting; learning about various "smart" materials that can be integrated into fabric; and developing deeper knowledge of electronics and circuitry. This position will require both hands on construction of smart textiles as well as software work.  /  /

						<p>Concrete is the most utilized construction material in the world and the second-most consumed material on Earth after water. Consequently, its production, use, and disposal has global environmental consequences. For example, the manufacture of cement alone is responsible for 5-8% of global carbon dioxide emissions. In addition to neg, concrete sequesters non-trivial amounts of CO2 via carbonation – a chemical reaction between cement paste and CO2. This project will employ a previously validated model that predicts carbon sequestration potential of concrete and extend it to other concrete products, namely hemp-lime concrete (aka hempcrete), a novel insulation material for energy efficient buildings. The model will account for cement type and content, exposure, and time. The model will be used to investigate the effect of these factors and the influence of compressive strength and geometry, namely surface-area-to-volume (SA/V) ratio, on total carbon sequestration of hemp-lime concrete.

						<p>As electronic devices become thinner, thermal management is becoming a critical issue. And in the push for flexible electronics, traditional methods of heat removal are becoming more challenging. Our group is developing ultra thin, flexible thermal ground planes using microfabricated polymer heat pipes, as an enabling technology for future 1-mm thin smartphones. Major challenges associated with this project include hermetic sealing with atomic layer deposition (ALD) inorganic barrier films, design of flexible structures to enable a 90-degree bend without cracking, charging the microfluidic system to eliminate non-condensable gasses, and developing wicking structures with hydrophilic ALD films. Research tasks will be associated with the assembly, testing, and characterization of the thermal and fluid transport. This project will provide training in polymer device microfabrication and assembly, thermal and fluid structure characterization, and design of microsystems for thermal management.

						<p>The project proposes to introduce novel mechanisms to modulate and direct phonon propagation based on the new paradigm of topologically engineered energy transport in nanoscale materials. The proposed mechanism will not only enable to hinder phonon propagation in thermoelectric materials without introduction of additional scattering losses for electronic transport, furthermore, the concept will enhance our ability to create and manipulate ultra-long lived coherent phonon modes that have emerged as a crucial new resource in quantum information processing and sensing technologies.

						<p>Climate extremes (eg wildfire, flooding, and drought) can adversely impact the nation's drinking water sources. This research aims to develop a web-based application (e.g. R Shiny: https://shiny.rstudio.com/ or Bokeh: http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) to help utilities understand their risk of experiencing one of these events. To do so, an undergraduate researcher will perform a literature review on the impact of climate extremes on water quality, perform statistical analyses on the frequency and severity of various climate extremes, and create a national risk plot for wildfires, floods, and droughts. The project will culminate in a web-based computer app that can be shared with stakeholders to aid in their understanding of risks to their systems.  This application will be paired with results from simulation models of drinking water treatment performance to help utilities understand their resilience to these events and aid in long-term decision making.  The project couples a team of professors and one or more graduate students on an EPA-funded multi-year research project.  The main advisor will be a senior graduate student who is an expert in decision support for drinking water.

						<p>The purpose of this DLA project is to study the experiences and perceptions of individuals as they move from capstone courses into workplaces. It is increasingly important that we prepare our new engineering graduates to quickly and effectively contribute to the engineering workplace, and capstone design courses are central to this preparation. However, research highlights the differences between that which engineers do at work and the kinds of training they receive in school. Using a multi-case approach, this investigation seeks to understand how and to what extent capstone design courses prepare students to effectively enter communities of practice in engineering workplaces. The DLA student will meet weekly with faculty and be involved in collecting and analyzing data obtained through qualitative interviews and weekly reflective workplace surveys as well as selecting the cohort for the next year of the investigation. The anticipated findings include answers to research questions regarding preparation, developed skills, and important teaching practices that enable us to better understand how students move from capstone design courses into engineering workplaces. /  /

						<p>Most conventional medical stents were made from metal to keep vessel or urethra open, however, neointimal hyperplasia and smooth muscle cells accumulation are reported for bare metal stents, which leads to inflammation and turbulent blood flow. Another issue occurs when implanting the stent into the vessel. Doctors need to insert a balloon catheter into patient’s vessel during surgery, which may cause pain, damage to the tissue and even inflammation to the healthy part. Shape memory polymers (SMP), apart from the bio-inert property, offers more potentials to realize a smart and flexible bio-medical stent. In this research, we used SMP as the structure material for the stent and integrated sensors that at the same time detect the bio-condition. Currently we are working on mixing Nano-Ferro-Magnetic particles with our SMPs to achieve remotely controlling the moving of the stent and the place it fixed. Considering that we could always adjust the transition temperature by change the chemical ratio in our formula, it will be more promising to trigger the transition at a little higher than body temperature, and alternating magnetic field could adopt to heat up the stent.

						<p>Shape-Memory Polymers (SMPs) have unique properties that allow them to alter their shape in response to specific stimuli. By bonding a pre-strained, thermally-responsive Shape Memory Polymer film to an elastomeric substrate of similar thickness, applying localized heat between the layers causes contraction of the SMP layer, and a bending motion of the entire bi-layer system. This project aims to study the relationship between the programming conditions of the SMP, substrate thickness, and bending curvature. Experimental results are compared to a theoretical, finite element model. This knowledge is then used to realize deployable structures through origami self-folding.

						<p>Space habitat environmental control uses multi-layer insulation and thermal shields to passively protect the habitat from both hot and cold external environments, then Active Thermal Control Systems keep the cabin temperature within the desired range. Typically, water cooling loops pick up heat from cold plates attached to the electronic equipment and experiments. The heated water then flows through interface heat exchangers to external coolant loops that then transport the heat to radiators, which in turn reject the heat to space. / Ground-based development of cooling loops, heat exchangers and radiators requires thermal vacuum chambers (TVACs) to simulate the space environment during experiments. An AES Bioastronautics Laboratory TVAC was designed to test integrated systems, but still needs work to complete the development and installation of the liquid nitrogen (LN2) cooling shroud. / A student on this project will rework and test a cylindrical LN2 shroud. Then, the student will design, build and test flat-plate LN2 shrouds for the chamber endcap and door.
