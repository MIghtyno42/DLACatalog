						<li>The goal of the ninja car project is to demonstrate on-board perception, planning and control algorithms for driving ground vehicles capable of dynamic ?gymnastic moves? such as jumping, drifting, rolling, bouncing, tumbling or wall-driving. This capability for fast, lightweight autonomous ground vehicles is possible due to the confluence of innovative algorithms for perception, planning and control, as well as new actuators and small form factor computing. Our platform of choice is a small 1/8th scale off-road racing vehicle, modified with sensing, jump-actuation and on-board computing. Our goal is to reliably automate the execution of these dynamic, ?gymnastic? maneuvers. We envision ninja cars launching off inclined surfaces, bouncing down walls, jumping through open windows, much like human parkour runners fly through urban spaces today. The question arises: where can such a novel class of vehicle actually drive?  How much of the world is accessible to this class of vehicle? These platforms will be useful in a variety of contexts including cluttered terrain navigation, long-term surveillance, and high-speed pursuit using a variety of novel control maneuvers, such as jumping.

In the aftermath of the earthquake, national and local governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are assisting communities repair and rebuild homes. As a part of this project, we are trying to understand how community members participate in housing reconstruction, how reconstructed houses will perform in a future hazard event, and how participation and performance impact community resilience. In the coming year, we will be examining participation and performance specifically. The graduate research assistant (GRA) will be performing observations, conducting interviews, collecting documents, and taking measurements to accrue data on community participation in the planning, design, and construction of post-disaster housing as well as the design and construction quality. The DLA can expect to assist in the analysis of this data with such tasks as qualitative coding of interview transcripts, calibration of data for qualitative comparative analysis, and the creation of structural models for the various housing typologies. /

The Haitian electrical power distribution grid was accessible to only about 10\% of the population before the earthquake of January 2010. Much of that infrastructure was destroyed. Practically, the Haitian grid of the future will have to grow from localized green energy farms be they photovoltaic, micro/pico hydro and/or wind. This development will require the training of a Haitian green energy work force as well as fundamentally new knowledge about design of power grids that are fundamentally variable in output. A micro-grid developed in Sud-Ouest, Haiti was devastated during Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. We have recently installed a micro-grid at are partners (ITCS) training site in southwest Haiti. We will continue monitoring as well as expanding this micro-grid. Students working with the program will assist in green energy research while interfacing with students, practitioners and researchers in Haiti. /

						<li>Optical fiber is the chosen medium for high data rate (Gbps) interconnections that are longer than circa 10 meters. Most recently, fiber has been applied to interconnecting the rack tops of warehouse scale data centers (WSC?s). Fiber itself is only useful for point to point interconnections. Electronics distributes signals to optical modulators for multiplexing and from optical detectors for processing. Integrated optical technologies in semiconductors are becoming more sophisticated. Such technologies can be be used to integrate operations of modulation, multiplexing and switching using chip real estate almost as compact as those offered by electronics. These integrated optical technologies have yet to find widespread use in networks primarily because of problems of interconnecting them to electronics, optical fiber but more importantly in the case of data centers and supercomputers, finding a compelling need. For example, operations that are better performed optically in those data racks that are fiber optically linked together. In this work we are investigating compelling needs through modeling and experiment.

In this project we will develop advanced display concepts and novel control modes to enhance the astronaut pilot landing performance and safety.

In particular, we want to understand how coursework supports their professional identity development during the school-to-work transition. To achieve this, we have previously conducted interviews with students early in their CS senior project experience and at the conclusion of their senior project experience. Next steps may include conducting interviews with students during their junior year, observations of current seniors on their projects, and with graduates of the CS program from the past few years. Conducting interviews and analyzing responses for patterns will be performed. /  / In addition, we are interested in designing surveys to automatically collect information about how students actually value and make use of software engineering practices. Why do students not make use of best practices during their coursework? How does valuing best practices connect to development of a professional identity and a sense of belonging in the computing profession?

						<li>This project uses computer simulations to optimize the location of groundwater monitoring wells to properly characterize the effectiveness of in situ remediation of contaminated groundwater.  During in situ groundwater remediation, a chemical or biological amendment is introduced into a contaminant plume to react with and degrade the contaminant.  The reactions occur at the contact area between the amendment and contaminant plumes.  We have developed a novel method that uses time-varying flow fields to increase the contact area and enhance degradation.  The effectiveness of the method has been demonstrated through computer simulations, which solve for concentrations of contaminant, amendment, and reaction product throughout the domain.  In a field setting, however, concentration data can only be collected at a finite number of wells, whose locations must be chosen strategically to maximize the amount of useful information available to evaluate the effectiveness of the method. The purpose of this project is to identify the set of optimal well locations that balances the tradeoff between maximizing the information obtained and minimizing cost.

						<li>Perceptual learning is the technique of showing many training instances to a human learner, usually in visual manner, and forcing the learner to make a prediction/label while providing feedback. When done appropriately, this can develop a gut instinct in the learner, which appears to be how many human experts operate (i.e., a chess master can glance at a chess board and quickly form a first impression about the strength of a position; a forester can glance at a far-off tree and guess the species).  There is some software to automate this, called perceptual learning modules (PLM), but these PLM require the user to input a training set of labeled images which is clearly very time consuming. This project would create a PLM website that uses google image search to automatically generate the training set, so that the user specifies only the labels (such as ?pine tree? and ?spruce tree?) and the website generates corresponding training images. Students must be comfortable with web programming (accessing data via API?s, and building dynamic webpages).

						<li>The goal of the ninja car project is to demonstrate on-board perception, planning and control algorithms for driving ground vehicles capable of dynamic ?gymnastic moves? such as jumping, drifting, rolling, bouncing, tumbling or wall-driving. This capability for fast, lightweight autonomous ground vehicles is possible due to the confluence of innovative algorithms for perception, planning and control, as well as new actuators and small form factor computing. Our platform of choice is a small 1/8th scale off-road racing vehicle, modified with sensing, jump-actuation and on-board computing. Our goal is to reliably automate the execution of these dynamic, ?gymnastic? maneuvers. We envision ninja cars launching off inclined surfaces, bouncing down walls, jumping through open windows, much like human parkour runners fly through urban spaces today. The question arises: where can such a novel class of vehicle actually drive? How much of the world is accessible to this class of vehicle? These platforms will be useful in a variety of contexts including cluttered terrain navigation, long-term surveillance, and high-speed pursuit using a variety of novel control maneuvers, such as jumping.

						<li>The popularity of devices like FitBits and other fitness trackers as a way to collect data about everyday activities (steps, calories burned, distance traveled) have changed how we think about the kinds of data that can be collected from our "everyday" activities and used to self-reflect about what makes us happier, healthier, more productive, or more stressed. These kinds of "trace data" can also be collected about other activities that we undertake during the course of a typical day -- for example, the ways that we work with our computers and mobile devices, the information that we share with others, the places that we go when we're working (and not), and our patterns of working time and leisure time. All of these bits of information help to paint a picture about how we get things done a day-to-day basis, with whom, and when our "getting things done" is making us happy...and when it isn't. In this project, a DLA apprentice will work with an interdisciplinary INFO/CS research group to build tools that will collect data about the when, where, who, and with-whom that information work takes place, as well as dashboards to help people make sense of these everyday activity "traces."

						<li>Concrete is the most utilized construction material in the world and the second-most consumed material on Earth after water. Consequently, its production, use, and disposal has global environmental consequences. For example, the manufacture of cement alone is responsible for 5-8% of global carbon dioxide emissions. In addition to neg, concrete sequesters non-trivial amounts of CO2 via carbonation ? a chemical reaction between cement paste and CO2. This project will employ a previously validated model that predicts carbon sequestration potential of concrete and extend it to other concrete products, namely hemp-lime concrete (aka hempcrete), a novel insulation material for energy efficient buildings. The model will account for cement type and content, exposure, and time. The model will be used to investigate the effect of these factors and the influence of compressive strength and geometry, namely surface-area-to-volume (SA/V) ratio, on total carbon sequestration of hemp-lime concrete.

However, research highlights the differences between that which engineers do at work and the kinds of training they receive in school. Using a multi-case approach, this investigation seeks to understand how and to what extent capstone design courses prepare students to effectively enter communities of practice in engineering workplaces. The DLA student will meet weekly with faculty and be involved in collecting and analyzing data obtained through qualitative interviews and weekly reflective workplace surveys as well as selecting the cohort for the next year of the investigation.

						<li>Silicon-germanium interfaces are one of the most widely studied interfaces due to their potential applications as thermoelectric materials in several energy conversion devices (e.g., multi-mission radioisotope generators in space missions). While several studies have addressed these systems, a clear understanding regarding the precise role of interfaces in nanostructured Si-Ge materials is not yet available. As interfaces control the functionalities of nanomaterials, to tailor the thermoelectric efficiency of Si-Ge applications, the role of various point defects at the interfaces, and how they influence the energy transport properties is crucial. Overall, the project aims towards designing next-generation thermoelectric materials.

						<li>Heat generation limits the performance of a new generation of power electronics including inverters for solar power, DC converters in data centers, solid state power amplifiers, and laser systems. In such systems, the heat flux can be 1,000 W/cm2?close to that of the surface of the sun. We are developing as methods of mitigating such ultrahigh heat loads using enhanced capillary-fed boiling in vapor chambers.  Major challenges with this project include micro/nano fabrication of capillary wick structures, improving test fixtures for high heat flux, atomic layer deposition (ALD) based encapsulation to protect the wick from harsh environments, and developing models of the heat transfer. Research tasks will be associated with the fabrication, assembly, testing, and characterization of the thermal and fluid transport, as well as corrosion-protection effectiveness of ALD films.

						<li>Climate extremes (eg wildfire, flooding, and drought) can adversely impact the nation's drinking water sources. This research aims to develop a web-based application (e.g. R Shiny: https://shiny.rstudio.com/ or Bokeh: http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) to help utilities understand their risk of experiencing one of these events. To do so, an undergraduate researcher will perform a literature review on the impact of climate extremes on water quality, perform statistical analyses on the frequency and severity of various climate extremes, and create a national risk plot for wildfires, floods, and droughts. The project will culminate in a web-based computer app that can be shared with stakeholders to aid in their understanding of risks to their systems.  This application will be paired with results from simulation models of drinking water treatment performance to help utilities understand their resilience to these events and aid in long-term decision making.  The project couples a team of professors and one or more graduate students on an EPA-funded multi-year research project.  The main advisor will be a senior graduate student who is an expert in decision support for drinking water.

						<li>The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) is a constellation of satellites operated by the United States Air Force.  Three of the DMSP space environment instruments measure 1) local electric fields; 2) local magnetic fields; and 3) plasma particle flux in Low Earth Orbit. These data are available at two institutions: the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) and the NASA OMNIweb data base. We are interested in joining the data bases from the institutions to estimate energy deposition into the upper atmosphere along the satellite track.  Of particular interest is the relative location of energy being deposited by fields alone (Poynting flux) and by particles alone. Most energy seems to be coming into the auroral zones, however some recent investigations suggest that significant energy is coming into the polar cap.  This project will investigate how the energy deposition varies as the space atmosphere interaction region experiences different kinds of ?forcing? due to disturbances propagating from the Sun.  /
