				<p>The goal of the ninja car project is to demonstrate on-board 
			perception, planning and control algorithms for driving ground vehicles 
			capable of dynamic “gymnastic moves” such as jumping, drifting, rolling, 
			bouncing, tumbling or wall-driving. This capability for fast, lightweight 
			autonomous ground vehicles is possible due to the confluence of innovative 
			algorithms for perception, planning and control, as well as new actuators 
			and small form factor computing. Our platform of choice is a small 1/8th 
			scale off-road racing vehicle, modified with sensing, jump-actuation and 
			on-board computing. Our goal is to reliably automate the execution of 
			these dynamic, “gymnastic” maneuvers. We envision ninja cars launching 
			off inclined surfaces, bouncing down walls, jumping through open windows, 
			much like human parkour runners fly through urban spaces today. 
			The question arises: where can such a novel class of vehicle actually drive?  
			How much of the world is accessible to this class of vehicle? 
			These platforms will be useful in a variety of contexts including cluttered 
			terrain navigation, long-term surveillance, and high-speed pursuit using 
			a variety of novel control maneuvers, such as jumping.

				Required skills are a familiarity with control theory, differential equations, 
				and linear algebra.
			</p>
			<p>
				Preferred skills are a familiarity with GitHub, C++, 
				computer vision, and previous experience with mechanical and electrical systems.
			</p> 
			<p>
				Despite close cooperation with Professor Heckman and the Autonomous Robotics 
				and Perception Group, students are encouraged to be capable of working both as a close 
				member of a team as well as independently.
