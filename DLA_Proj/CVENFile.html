						<li>In urban environments, infrastructure components are not isolated. Due to their close proximity, they interact with one another during earthquakes by affecting the static and dynamic stresses in the underlying interface soil. The research objective is to identify the key predictors of the performance of a building cluster on softened ground by: (1) performing centrifuge experiments to fundamentally evaluate multiple structure-soil-structure interaction on liquefiable ground and the impact and relative importance of the properties of building, ground motion, mitigation strategy, and cluster on the EDPs of structure and surrounding soil; (2) developing validated nonlinear numerical models of the coupled structure-soil-structure systems that are studied experimentally; and (3) performing a preliminary parametric study with the calibrated numerical models to define the most efficient ground motion predicting parameters of the performance of building clusters on softened ground. The undergraduate student involved in this project will be heavily involved in centrifuge modeling and data processing/visualization component of this research.

						<li>Micro-grids for Smart Villages is a collaboration of UCB faculty, the Mortenson Center for Engineering in Developing Communities (MC-EDC), The IEEE Smart Village Program (ISV) and L?Institut Technique de la C“te-Sud (ITCS), Coteaux, Sud-Ouest, Haiti. The Haitian electrical power distribution grid was accessible to only about 10\% of the population before the earthquake of January 2010. Much of that infrastructure was destroyed. Practically, the Haitian grid of the future will have to grow from localized green energy farms be they photovoltaic, micro/pico hydro and/or wind. This development will require the training of a Haitian green energy work force as well as fundamentally new knowledge about design of power grids that are fundamentally variable in output. A micro-grid developed in Sud-Ouest, Haiti was devastated during Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. We have recently installed a micro-grid at are partners (ITCS) training site in southwest Haiti. We will continue monitoring as well as expanding this micro-grid. Students working with the program will assist in green energy research while interfacing with students, practitioners and researchers in Haiti. /

						<li>Sustainable sanitation systems require the functional integration of infrastructure and society; however, most studies focus on technology innovation and do not adequately account for how human behavior and social needs affect, and are affected by, sanitation systems. In resource-limited communities, sanitation systems continue to experience high failure rates. To address this gap, this research aims to elucidate the community processes (community priorities, stakeholder engagement processes, and training processes) and infrastructure designs that result in sustainable sanitation systems. Data collected from 20 communities in India will be used in the analysis. We will analyze how combined community processes and infrastructure designs affect the sustainability of sanitation and integrated sanitation and resource recovery systems using Qualitative Comparative Analysis. We will develop metrics to  evaluate the social, behavioral, and environmental impacts of sanitation and resource recovery systems in a life cycle analysis. Responsibilities will include coding and analyzing qualitative interview data, literature review, and assisting with conference and journal article authorship. /

						<li>This project uses computer simulations to optimize the location of groundwater monitoring wells to properly characterize the effectiveness of in situ remediation of contaminated groundwater.  During in situ groundwater remediation, a chemical or biological amendment is introduced into a contaminant plume to react with and degrade the contaminant.  The reactions occur at the contact area between the amendment and contaminant plumes.  We have developed a novel method that uses time-varying flow fields to increase the contact area and enhance degradation.  The effectiveness of the method has been demonstrated through computer simulations, which solve for concentrations of contaminant, amendment, and reaction product throughout the domain.  In a field setting, however, concentration data can only be collected at a finite number of wells, whose locations must be chosen strategically to maximize the amount of useful information available to evaluate the effectiveness of the method. The purpose of this project is to identify the set of optimal well locations that balances the tradeoff between maximizing the information obtained and minimizing cost.

						<li>This research project explores the future of textiles, the materials that make up clothes, drapery and upholstery. New methods for combining smart materials and conductive threads allow us to create textiles that can change color and shape in response to computational data. For instance, your shirt might change its pattern upon receiving and email or a stripe could travel between your shirt and the shirt of a nearby friend. A key challenge in developing new interactive behaviors for textiles is the lack of design software for creating and simulating different interactive behaviors. Thus, I am seeking a student who can help design software interfaces for programmable knitting and weaving machines that will allow people to design and simulate various computational behaviors on fabrics. This will involve learning both about traditional fabric production techniques like weaving and knitting; learning about various "smart" materials that can be integrated into fabric; and developing deeper knowledge of electronics and circuitry.

						<li>The purpose of this DLA project is to study the experiences and perceptions of individuals as they move from capstone courses into workplaces. It is increasingly important that we prepare our new engineering graduates to quickly and effectively contribute to the engineering workplace, and capstone design courses are central to this preparation. However, research highlights the differences between that which engineers do at work and the kinds of training they receive in school. Using a multi-case approach, this investigation seeks to understand how and to what extent capstone design courses prepare students to effectively enter communities of practice in engineering workplaces. The DLA student will meet weekly with faculty and be involved in collecting and analyzing data obtained through qualitative interviews and weekly reflective workplace surveys as well as selecting the cohort for the next year of the investigation. The anticipated findings include answers to research questions regarding preparation, developed skills, and important teaching practices that enable us to better understand how students move from capstone design courses into engineering workplaces. /  /

						<li>This research aims to decipher the interplay between the microstructural length scales intrinsic to granular geomaterials and the wave transmission characteristics of such media over a wide frequency spectrum. In this spirit, the proposed developments are focused on examining the dispersion and attenuation of longitudinal (and flexural) waves in soil specimens of various composition. An experimental setup is proposed where a cylindrical sample of dried soil is held between a pair of source/receiver transducers under a prescribed static prestress. The (source) transducer is excited by a narrow-band modulated 5-cycle sine burst with carrier frequency fc and bandwidth 0.1fc. Thus-induced wave motion in soil is captured (a) by the (receiver) transducer, and (b) via either a high- speed camera (available in the Geotechnical Centrifuge Lab). The specimen is a periodic assembly of unit cells comprised of a certain composition of soil grains, which may be manufactured (a) by encasing the soil assembly in a plastic wrap of infinitesimal thickness, and (b) via sequential processing where (dry) soil particles are first assembled in a suitable container; the sample is then saturated (either by water or meta-cellulose) and subsequently oven-baked; thus-obtained (dried) column of soil retains its shape for the purpose of dynamical testing. A high-fidelity algorithm rooted in Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is then developed aiming to map the image sequences captured by the high-speed camera into the particle velocity distribution (in time and space) on the soil surface. A cross-correlation technique is invoked to determine the phase shift between the measured signals at multiple scan points, that is eventually used to estimate the phase velocity at a given carrier frequency fc. In this setting, the dispersion curves are constructed experimentally by repeating the measurements over a desired span of carrier frequencies fc. The results will be used to validate the outcome of the analytical and computational campaigns in progress parallel to the development of the experimental side. Interested students will experience hands-on experiments on wave phenomena, and learn advanced signal/image processing methods as universal data-processing tools. The fun part of this project is its very interdisciplinary nature.
