					<p>In urban environments, infrastructure components are not isolated. Due to their close proximity, they interact with one another during earthquakes by affecting the static and dynamic stresses in the underlying interface soil. The research objective is to identify the key predictors of the performance of a building cluster on softened ground by: (1) performing centrifuge experiments to fundamentally evaluate multiple structure-soil-structure interaction on liquefiable ground and the impact and relative importance of the properties of building, ground motion, mitigation strategy, and cluster on the EDPs of structure and surrounding soil; (2) developing validated nonlinear numerical models of the coupled structure-soil-structure systems that are studied experimentally; and (3) performing a preliminary parametric study with the calibrated numerical models to define the most efficient ground motion predicting parameters of the performance of building clusters on softened ground. The undergraduate student involved in this project will be heavily involved in centrifuge modeling and data processing/visualization component of this research.

					<p>The goal of the ninja car project is to demonstrate on-board perception, planning and control algorithms for driving ground vehicles capable of dynamic “gymnastic moves” such as jumping, drifting, rolling, bouncing, tumbling or wall-driving. This capability for fast, lightweight autonomous ground vehicles is possible due to the confluence of innovative algorithms for perception, planning and control, as well as new actuators and small form factor computing. Our platform of choice is a small 1/8th scale off-road racing vehicle, modified with sensing, jump-actuation and on-board computing. Our goal is to reliably automate the execution of these dynamic, “gymnastic” maneuvers. We envision ninja cars launching off inclined surfaces, bouncing down walls, jumping through open windows, much like human parkour runners fly through urban spaces today. The question arises: where can such a novel class of vehicle actually drive?  How much of the world is accessible to this class of vehicle? These platforms will be useful in a variety of contexts including cluttered terrain navigation, long-term surveillance, and high-speed pursuit using a variety of novel control maneuvers, such as jumping.

					<p>Micro-grids for Smart Villages is a collaboration of UCB faculty, the Mortenson Center for Engineering in Developing Communities (MC-EDC), The IEEE Smart Village Program (ISV) and L’Institut Technique de la Côte-Sud (ITCS), Coteaux, Sud-Ouest, Haiti. The Haitian electrical power distribution grid was accessible to only about 10\% of the population before the earthquake of January 2010. Much of that infrastructure was destroyed. Practically, the Haitian grid of the future will have to grow from localized green energy farms be they photovoltaic, micro/pico hydro and/or wind. This development will require the training of a Haitian green energy work force as well as fundamentally new knowledge about design of power grids that are fundamentally variable in output. A micro-grid developed in Sud-Ouest, Haiti was devastated during Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. We have recently installed a micro-grid at are partners (ITCS) training site in southwest Haiti. We will continue monitoring as well as expanding this micro-grid. Students working with the program will assist in green energy research while interfacing with students, practitioners and researchers in Haiti. /

					<p>Optical fiber is the chosen medium for high data rate (Gbps) interconnections that are longer than circa 10 meters. Most recently, fiber has been applied to interconnecting the rack tops of warehouse scale data centers (WSC’s). Fiber itself is only useful for point to point interconnections. Electronics distributes signals to optical modulators for multiplexing and from optical detectors for processing. Integrated optical technologies in semiconductors are becoming more sophisticated. Such technologies can be be used to integrate operations of modulation, multiplexing and switching using chip real estate almost as compact as those offered by electronics. These integrated optical technologies have yet to find widespread use in networks primarily because of problems of interconnecting them to electronics, optical fiber but more importantly in the case of data centers and supercomputers, finding a compelling need. For example, operations that are better performed optically in those data racks that are fiber optically linked together. In this work we are investigating compelling needs through modeling and experiment.

Our work seeks to utilize photonic crystals for coupling light to quantum emitters.  In order to utilize nanophotonic devices for our experiments it is imperative they can be placed in an ultrahigh vacuum environment where atomic quantum emitters can be well isolated.  There are many challenges associated with this task, including the optical coupling.  We are seeking to solve this challenge through a project involving optical design, testing and optimization.  A free-space optical laser beam will be coupled into an ultrahigh vacuum chamber, and the ability to efficiently couple into a device will be tested.

					<h4 align = "left">Description</h4>
					<p>This project uses computer simulations to optimize the location of groundwater monitoring wells to properly characterize the effectiveness of in situ remediation of contaminated groundwater.  During in situ groundwater remediation, a chemical or biological amendment is introduced into a contaminant plume to react with and degrade the contaminant.  The reactions occur at the contact area between the amendment and contaminant plumes.  We have developed a novel method that uses time-varying flow fields to increase the contact area and enhance degradation.  The effectiveness of the method has been demonstrated through computer simulations, which solve for concentrations of contaminant, amendment, and reaction product throughout the domain.  In a field setting, however, concentration data can only be collected at a finite number of wells, whose locations must be chosen strategically to maximize the amount of useful information available to evaluate the effectiveness of the method. The purpose of this project is to identify the set of optimal well locations that balances the tradeoff between maximizing the information obtained and minimizing cost.

					<p>The Harvest Oil Platform is located about 10 km off the coast of central California near Vandenberg Air Force Base. The platform is anchored to the sea floor and sits in about 200 m of water near the western entrance to the Santa Barbara Channel. Conditions at Harvest are typical of the open ocean: wind waves and swell average about 2 m, though waves up to 10 m have been experienced during powerful winter storms. Harvest Platform serves as the prime calibration site for the NASA TOPEX/POSEIDON (1992–2005), Jason-1 (2001–2013), OSTM/Jason-2 (2008–) and Jason-3 (2016–) missions, and is an important international resource for the study of sea level from space. Harvest continues to serve a crucial role in validating data from precise spaceborne radar altimeter systems. The principal objectives of the proposed work are to preserve this vital long-term calibration record from Harvest, and to improve the skill with which the experiment can detect systematic errors in the altimeter measurement systems.  The DLA student will assist the calibration team at CU/CCAR and NASA JPL.

					<p>Antiferromagnets are materials where each molecule's spin is ordered so that neighboring spins point in opposite directions. Recently, antiferromagnets have been considered attractive materials for spintronics applications, i.e., those that use spin current rather than or in addition to charge current in circuitry. The Dispersive Hydrodynamics Laboratory (DHL) is investigating spin dynamics in magnetic materials utilizing a novel hydrodynamic formulation that DHL members recently derived for a class of ferromagnets.  This theory interprets spin dynamics in a solid state magnet as fluid dynamics for which spin-density waves and nonlinear structures such as magnetic vortices can be better understood. The student who pursues this project will extend the hydrodynamic partial differential equations to antiferromagnetic materials, building upon work by DHL group members. Special solutions known as uniform hydrodynamic states and spin-density waves will be derived. Their dynamic stability and associated dispersion relation shall be assessed.  Finally, the student will search for other nonlinear structures, such as solitons, dispersive shock waves, and vortices.

					<p>The goal of the ninja car project is to demonstrate on-board perception, planning and control algorithms for driving ground vehicles capable of dynamic “gymnastic moves” such as jumping, drifting, rolling, bouncing, tumbling or wall-driving. This capability for fast, lightweight autonomous ground vehicles is possible due to the confluence of innovative algorithms for perception, planning and control, as well as new actuators and small form factor computing. Our platform of choice is a small 1/8th scale off-road racing vehicle, modified with sensing, jump-actuation and on-board computing. Our goal is to reliably automate the execution of these dynamic, “gymnastic” maneuvers. We envision ninja cars launching off inclined surfaces, bouncing down walls, jumping through open windows, much like human parkour runners fly through urban spaces today. The question arises: where can such a novel class of vehicle actually drive? How much of the world is accessible to this class of vehicle? These platforms will be useful in a variety of contexts including cluttered terrain navigation, long-term surveillance, and high-speed pursuit using a variety of novel control maneuvers, such as jumping.

					<p>Concrete is the most utilized construction material in the world and the second-most consumed material on Earth after water. Consequently, its production, use, and disposal has global environmental consequences. For example, the manufacture of cement alone is responsible for 5-8% of global carbon dioxide emissions. In addition to neg, concrete sequesters non-trivial amounts of CO2 via carbonation – a chemical reaction between cement paste and CO2. This project will employ a previously validated model that predicts carbon sequestration potential of concrete and extend it to other concrete products, namely hemp-lime concrete (aka hempcrete), a novel insulation material for energy efficient buildings. The model will account for cement type and content, exposure, and time. The model will be used to investigate the effect of these factors and the influence of compressive strength and geometry, namely surface-area-to-volume (SA/V) ratio, on total carbon sequestration of hemp-lime concrete.

However, research highlights the differences between that which engineers do at work and the kinds of training they receive in school. Using a multi-case approach, this investigation seeks to understand how and to what extent capstone design courses prepare students to effectively enter communities of practice in engineering workplaces. The DLA student will meet weekly with faculty and be involved in collecting and analyzing data obtained through qualitative interviews and weekly reflective workplace surveys as well as selecting the cohort for the next year of the investigation.

					<p>Thin films and membranes are ubiquitous in nature and technology, with examples including mylar films used in solar sails, biological membranes, thin metallic coatings, and flexible electronics. When such structures are subjected to complex stress states, such as shear, compression or non-equibiaxial loading, they can form wrinkles and permanent creases, which in turn affect their mechanical response. In order to design structures using this thin elements, it is important to understand their response to non trivial loading. /  / This project will combine experiments with numerical and theoretical analysis, in order to explore the behavior of thin films and membranes. One of the main goals is the design and assembly of an experimental apparatus able to apply different biaxial loadings to thin membranes, in order to excite different states of stress in the material. The set-up will test different specimens, such as commercial films (mylar) and elastomeric membranes built by the student. /  / The work will be done in close collaboration with an incoming PhD student.

					<p>Several designs for deployable space structures require materials that are able to be folded to very high curvatures, in order to fit in the launch vehicle, yet still remain a high stiffness once deployed. An interesting option are high strain composites, which are fiber composites in which the material and layout selection are designed to increase the curvature at which they fail when bent. However, the failure properties of this family of materials is still not understood, which prevents their use in practical designs. /  / The goal of this project is to study the failure of this type of flexible composites under different loading conditions, with emphasis on bending. The student will adapt existing testing equipment to the specific needs of this specimens (very low axial loading, large rotations), and develop a protocol to test them until failure. The samples will then analyzed, in order to identify the failure mechanisms taking place. This observation will be used to create physics-based models that can be incorporated in the design cycle of deployable structures. /  / The work will be performed in collaboration with an incoming PhD student.

					<p>A novel polarization sensitive laser radar (lidar) has been under development for several years in my Active Remote Sensing Lab (ARSENL). This innovative system has led to a number of different applications, developments, and patents. To promote the lidar technique and my lab’s capability, there is a need to develop a lidar hardware/software demonstrator in the lab. The DLA project goal is to build a lidar bathymetry system in the lab that includes a mounting/scanning system over a water tank for observing submerged objects. There are several options for student participation from machining the mount system, constructing the lidar, to developing software for acquiring and displaying the lidar measurements. A DLA student with an interest in hands-on lab work (potential help with field work), system engineering, and remote sensing technologies is preferred.

					<p>This project focuses on using a custom-built stereolithography system to manufacture 3D tissue engineering scaffolds. 3D printed biocompatible scaffolds can be used in applications ranging from three-dimensional cell culture for drug testing to personalized regenerative implants for tissue engineering. This work focuses on fabricating mechanically stiff constructs for cartilage tissue engineering and regeneration. Due to the relatively large physiological loads imparted on cartilage tissue, the mechanical properties of the constructs must be well understood, predictable, and applied in our 3D printing software design. The student working on this project will concentrate on the optimization and validation of novel material characterization models under the supervision of a materials science graduate student, for the development of 3D printing software that incorporates this model. The undergraduate on this project will gain experience with LabVIEW and Matlab by writing a software that predicts the parameters necessary for desired 3D printed construct properties. Additionally, the undergraduate will test the software by learning to fabricate complex constructs and learning to use mec
