						<p>Graphitic carbon is often used as a support in heterogeneous catalysis due to its high surface area and high stability in both basic and acidic environments. Previous work has shown that functionalization of catalyst supports is an attractive approach for tuning catalyst performance in many reactions.  Our laboratory has developed strategies to functionalize metal-oxide catalyst supports (e.g. alumina, silica, etc.) with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) that can dramatically improve catalyst performance in a variety of chemistries.  Though there has been a significant amount of study of carbon as a support for various catalysts, little effort has been made to develop strategies to functionalize graphitic carbon with SAMs. Thus, the goal of this project will be to oxidize different forms of carbon to varying degrees, including treatments in nitric acid or ozone, to identify conditions that allow SAM formation on the surface. We will also determine the effects of the organic SAMS on catalysis in various reaction chemistries in solution. In doing so, we believe we can develop novel catalysts with tunable near-surface environments for biomass refining and other applications.

						<p>Atomic Force Microscopes (AFMs) enable imaging down to the atomic scale (to a resolution of 1 Angstrom (10^{-10} meter)) and can image in liquids and also do not require imaging in vacuum. As a result, AFMs have become very popular imaging instruments in a number of fields. However, imaging speeds of commercial AFMs are very slow (minutes to acquire each image). This project investigates methods to improve AFM imaging speeds. A goal in this research community is to enable video rate AFM imaging speeds, so that the dynamics of e.g., biological phenomena can be studied. This overall project is a collaboration with researchers at Boston University. Our roles here at CU in this project include modeling, signal processing, and controls, including implementation and demonstration of developed methods on an experimental AFM testbed in our research laboratory.
