					<p>An increasing number of governments and aid organizations are choosing to relocate affected communities, transferring them to less geographically risky sites, after a major disaster hits. However, relocation often has harmful socioeconomic side effects and fails to separate people from the original, and new, hazards. Many civil engineering and construction decisions throughout relocation project implementation are influential in the overall risk experienced by community members.  / This research focuses on the relocation of over 16,000 families displaced when Tyhpoon Haiyan tore through Tacloban City, Philippines, in November 2013. Based on fieldwork conducted in Tacloban City for five months in 2016 and future fieldwork in late 2017, the Discovery Learning Apprentice will work closely with research team to build indicators for holistic risk reduction and use them to assess project outcomes at 12 relocation sites in Tacloban City. The student will learn and work closely with NVivo software and Qualitative Comparative Analysis.  /

					<h4 align = "left">Description</h4>
					<p>This project uses computer simulations to optimize the location of groundwater monitoring wells to properly characterize the effectiveness of in situ remediation of contaminated groundwater.  During in situ groundwater remediation, a chemical or biological amendment is introduced into a contaminant plume to react with and degrade the contaminant.  The reactions occur at the contact area between the amendment and contaminant plumes.  We have developed a novel method that uses time-varying flow fields to increase the contact area and enhance degradation.  The effectiveness of the method has been demonstrated through computer simulations, which solve for concentrations of contaminant, amendment, and reaction product throughout the domain.  In a field setting, however, concentration data can only be collected at a finite number of wells, whose locations must be chosen strategically to maximize the amount of useful information available to evaluate the effectiveness of the method. The purpose of this project is to identify the set of optimal well locations that balances the tradeoff between maximizing the information obtained and minimizing cost.

					<p>This research project explores the future of textiles, the materials that make up clothes, drapery and upholstery. New methods for combining smart materials and conductive threads allow us to create textiles that can change color and shape in response to computational data. For instance, your shirt might change its pattern upon receiving and email or a stripe could travel between your shirt and the shirt of a nearby friend. A key challenge in developing new interactive behaviors for textiles is the lack of design software for creating and simulating different interactive behaviors. Thus, I am seeking a student who can help design software interfaces for programmable knitting and weaving machines that will allow people to design and simulate various computational behaviors on fabrics. This will involve learning both about traditional fabric production techniques like weaving and knitting; learning about various "smart" materials that can be integrated into fabric; and developing deeper knowledge of electronics and circuitry. This position will require both hands on construction of smart textiles as well as software work.  /  /

					<p>With an aging population research regarding cognitive, developmental and physical disabilities is becoming increasingly important.  People with disabilities is a very underserved population and many of the clients have client specific needs that can not be met with available or affordable technology or devices.

The student would help to write up the research in journals so that other people with special needs have access to the research we have done.

I believe there is much to publish about the pedagogy of community based research.

					<p>Concrete is the most utilized construction material in the world and the second-most consumed material on Earth after water. Consequently, its production, use, and disposal has global environmental consequences. For example, the manufacture of cement alone is responsible for 5-8% of global carbon dioxide emissions. In addition to neg, concrete sequesters non-trivial amounts of CO2 via carbonation – a chemical reaction between cement paste and CO2. This project will employ a previously validated model that predicts carbon sequestration potential of concrete and extend it to other concrete products, namely hemp-lime concrete (aka hempcrete), a novel insulation material for energy efficient buildings. The model will account for cement type and content, exposure, and time. The model will be used to investigate the effect of these factors and the influence of compressive strength and geometry, namely surface-area-to-volume (SA/V) ratio, on total carbon sequestration of hemp-lime concrete.

					<p>The purpose of this DLA project is to study the experiences and perceptions of individuals as they move from capstone courses into workplaces. It is increasingly important that we prepare our new engineering graduates to quickly and effectively contribute to the engineering workplace, and capstone design courses are central to this preparation. However, research highlights the differences between that which engineers do at work and the kinds of training they receive in school. Using a multi-case approach, this investigation seeks to understand how and to what extent capstone design courses prepare students to effectively enter communities of practice in engineering workplaces. The DLA student will meet weekly with faculty and be involved in collecting and analyzing data obtained through qualitative interviews and weekly reflective workplace surveys as well as selecting the cohort for the next year of the investigation. The anticipated findings include answers to research questions regarding preparation, developed skills, and important teaching practices that enable us to better understand how students move from capstone design courses into engineering workplaces. /  /

					<h4 align = "left">Description</h4>
					<p>Several designs for deployable space structures require materials that are able to be folded to very high curvatures, in order to fit in the launch vehicle, yet still remain a high stiffness once deployed. An interesting option are high strain composites, which are fiber composites in which the material and layout selection are designed to increase the curvature at which they fail when bent. However, the failure properties of this family of materials is still not understood, which prevents their use in practical designs. /  / The goal of this project is to study the failure of this type of flexible composites under different loading conditions, with emphasis on bending. The student will adapt existing testing equipment to the specific needs of this specimens (very low axial loading, large rotations), and develop a protocol to test them until failure. The samples will then analyzed, in order to identify the failure mechanisms taking place. This observation will be used to create physics-based models that can be incorporated in the design cycle of deployable structures. /  / The work will be performed in collaboration with an incoming PhD student.
