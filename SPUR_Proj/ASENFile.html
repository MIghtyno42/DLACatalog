						<p>Under a NASA project we plan to collect unique distributed data sets suitable for NASA MODIS-CERES cloud radiation science and solar forecasting algorithm / development for renewable energy generation purposes. To develop the data sets necessary to optimally design a multi-sensor cloud camera network we propose to organize a team of ~100-200 citizen scientists using self-owned PDA cameras and offering sensor sites with WiFi access. The data sets will be observed over Boulder, CO, covering ~10-15% of Boulder County at 30-second resolution, and specifically during intervals of Aqua ascending afternoon (~1:40 PM local) overpasses. The data set will be used in 3D cloud reconstruction and forecasting algorithms to demonstrate a prototype distributed network. The project will benefit from the support of the City of Boulder, CO, for both organizing the citizen teams necessary for the data collection and for siting the network stations during an anticipated citizen-focused follow-on implementation phase. A low-cost and robust sensor design suitable for large scale / fabrication and long term deployment will be developed for the project.

						<p>Atomic Force Microscopes (AFMs) enable imaging down to the atomic scale (to a resolution of 1 Angstrom (10^{-10} meter)) and can image in liquids and also do not require imaging in vacuum. As a result, AFMs have become very popular imaging instruments in a number of fields. However, imaging speeds of commercial AFMs are very slow (minutes to acquire each image). This project investigates methods to improve AFM imaging speeds. A goal in this research community is to enable video rate AFM imaging speeds, so that the dynamics of e.g., biological phenomena can be studied. This overall project is a collaboration with researchers at Boston University. Our roles here at CU in this project include modeling, signal processing, and controls, including implementation and demonstration of developed methods on an experimental AFM testbed in our research laboratory.

						<p>The student will design and test a simple wing model at fixed angles of attack in the CU Low-Speed, Research Wind Tunnel. Stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry (SPIV) Data will be collected to quantify the velocity fields around the wing surface. The student will then determine the degree of nonphysical divergence in the vector field and whether it constitutes a major source of measurement uncertainty. This will be accomplished through comparisons with the correlation statistics uncertainty method used in the commercial DaVis SPIV Software.
