						<p>For the decade, oil and gas development in the United States has relied on horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to extract oil and gas from shale and tight sands. Hydraulic fracturing fluids include chemicals of concern for groundwater contamination. Recently, some oil and gas operators have claimed to make fracturing fluids "greener" -- to replace some potentially toxic compounds with less toxic compounds. The claims of greener fracturing fluids have not been confirmed. / / For this study, we intend to examine trends in the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluid from 2011 to the present using publicly-available data (the "FracFocus" database). Using the 120,000 records of hydraulic fracturing jobs across the United States, we will review use for geographical (by state, by oil and gas basin), hydrocarbon type (oil, wet gas, dry gas), and temporal trends. The temporal trends will be adjusted for geographic and hydrocarbon differences and assessed for changes in the frequency and amount of use of chemicals of concern.

						<p>Wei-Te Chen, a CS Ph.D. student, will be working with Dr. Vilja Hulden (History) who is associated with Digital Humanities to make software for Natural Language Processing already on campus more accessible to Digital Humanities students. This requires revising and repackaging pre-existing NLP toolkits that are currently in use at the CLEAR lab by CS and LING Ph.D. students. We do not anticipate this to require extensive software development, though it will possibly require rewriting some portions of code; mainly, however, the task will be to streamline the usability by providing some scaffolding and detailed documentation.   /  / An undergraduate CS student could be very helpful in making minor code change, testing the changes, and providing feedback on alternative system presentations, all under the supervision of Wei-Te Chen, Martha Palmer and Jim Martin. /

						<p>Graphitic carbon is often used as a support in heterogeneous catalysis due to its high surface area and high stability in both basic and acidic environments. Previous work has shown that functionalization of catalyst supports is an attractive approach for tuning catalyst performance in many reactions.  Our laboratory has developed strategies to functionalize metal-oxide catalyst supports (e.g. alumina, silica, etc.) with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) that can dramatically improve catalyst performance in a variety of chemistries.  Though there has been a significant amount of study of carbon as a support for various catalysts, little effort has been made to develop strategies to functionalize graphitic carbon with SAMs. Thus, the goal of this project will be to oxidize different forms of carbon to varying degrees, including treatments in nitric acid or ozone, to identify conditions that allow SAM formation on the surface. We will also determine the effects of the organic SAMS on catalysis in various reaction chemistries in solution. In doing so, we believe we can develop novel catalysts with tunable near-surface environments for biomass refining and other applications.

						<p>Atomic Force Microscopes (AFMs) enable imaging down to the atomic scale (to a resolution of 1 Angstrom (10^{-10} meter)) and can image in liquids and also do not require imaging in vacuum. As a result, AFMs have become very popular imaging instruments in a number of fields. However, imaging speeds of commercial AFMs are very slow (minutes to acquire each image). This project investigates methods to improve AFM imaging speeds. A goal in this research community is to enable video rate AFM imaging speeds, so that the dynamics of e.g., biological phenomena can be studied. This overall project is a collaboration with researchers at Boston University. Our roles here at CU in this project include modeling, signal processing, and controls, including implementation and demonstration of developed methods on an experimental AFM testbed in our research laboratory.

						<p>Raka will use reactive molecular dynamics simulations, along with DFT calculations to investigate the mechanism of oxidation of NiCr alloys in the presnce of oxygen. The mechanisms involves vacancy diffusion and has not been well understaood at the sclae of 1 to 100 nm. Atomistic models of alloy-oxide interfaces will be constructed, and the emergy profile of the oxidation reaction will be computed using novel force field parameters for the Ni alloys, alumins, and chromia. Preliminary data have shown that it is feasible to determine the rate determining step and predict oxidation (corrosion) rates. Raka will be supervised by Krishan Kanhaiya, a 2nd year PhD student in my research group, and by myself. She will have opportunity to present her progress ta group meetings and progress meetings with collaborators. A contribution to a peer-reviewed publication is possible depdending on progress.

						<p>Sustainable sanitation requires the functional integration of infrastructure and society; however, most studies focus on technology innovation and do not adequately account for the interconnection and affects of human behavior and needs. In resource-limited communities, sanitation systems continue to experience high failure rates. To address this gap, this research aims to elucidate the community processes (priorities, stakeholder engagement processes, and training) and infrastructure designs that result in sustainable sanitation systems. Data was collected from 20 communities India. We will analyze how combined community processes and infrastructure designs affect the sustainability of sanitation and integrated sanitation and resource recovery systems using Qualitative Comparative Analysis. We will develop metrics to  evaluate the social, behavioral, and environmental impacts of sanitation and resource recovery systems in a life cycle analysis. Responsibilities will include coding and analyzing qualitative interview data, literature review, performing economic analyses for systems, calculating resource recovery potential, and assisting with presentations and journal articles.
