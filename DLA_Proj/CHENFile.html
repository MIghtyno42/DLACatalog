						<li>The purpose of the project is to use atomic layer deposition (ALD) to coat aluminum nitride (AlN) particles with yttrium oxide sintering aid, to synthesize a colloidal gel using these coated particles, and to 3D print an optimized UV-LED heat sink from the gel, which is then fired into a dense part and tested for heat transfer.  AlN is highly thermally conductive, is an electrical insulator and is unaffected structurally by UV light.   The benefit of the project is to improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of UV-LED lighting through effective heat removal and minimized AlN use (part design).  The PI's lab is expert in ALD and non-oxide ceramic materials and developed this concept in response to a recognized need for UV-LED heat removal.  3D printing will Increase design freedom & provide the ability to design more functional parts (perform better with lattice structures not possible to incorporate by conventional processing).  ALD allows for improved fabricated ceramic parts with reduced flaw size.

						<li>"Cobalt atomic layer deposition (ALD) has been used previously in our lab to synthesize cobalt/Al2O3 catalysts highly active for Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS). This activity has been attributed to a cobalt morphology novel to both ALD and FTS; namely that cobalt is depositing epitaxially on the crystalline regions of the Al2O3 surface and creating cobalt monolayers. We believe that altering the Al2O3 support will allow us to control the cobalt deposition process during ALD and ultimately increase the activity of these catalysts for FTS. Undergraduate work will consist primarily of assisting in the catalyst synthesis process via Al2O3 modification, ALD system building/use, and testing these catalysts in the FTS reactors. This work will be followed by FTS product/activity analysis using a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer with possible additional work with surface characterization techniques such as temperature programmed reduction and chemisorption." /  / Evaluation will be that you will present a research review at the end of the spring semester and write up a letter report. /  /

						<li>An ideal redox material (which drives the process) to split water using concentrated sunlight has not yet been developed. Hence, this project has the goal of developing new spinel and perovskite metal oxide materials (Ph.D. student supervisor) having ideal thermodynamic, kinetic, and long-term reactivity. The U/G student will synthesize materials using a citrate gel process, characterize the materials using XRD, BET, ICP, and SEM, and test materials in a well-instrumented stagnation flow reactor at CU to measure hydrogen production capacity and reaction rates; and work with the Ph.D. student to develop reaction rate expressions for both oxidation and reduction steps. Our research group is the largest academic solarthermal research team in the U.S.   Key to ultimate project success is the discovery of robust materials that have high H2 productivity per mass of active material and can redox (reduction/oxidation) indefinitely without deactivation.  The Ph.D. student is supported by the NSF and her objective is to discover new materials using atomistic modeling (density functional theory) from nearly 2000 possibilities of perovskites and doped spinels.  The U/G DLA will support her.

In the aftermath of the earthquake, national and local governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are assisting communities repair and rebuild homes. As a part of this project, we are trying to understand how community members participate in housing reconstruction, how reconstructed houses will perform in a future hazard event, and how participation and performance impact community resilience. In the coming year, we will be examining participation and performance specifically. The graduate research assistant (GRA) will be performing observations, conducting interviews, collecting documents, and taking measurements to accrue data on community participation in the planning, design, and construction of post-disaster housing as well as the design and construction quality. The DLA can expect to assist in the analysis of this data with such tasks as qualitative coding of interview transcripts, calibration of data for qualitative comparative analysis, and the creation of structural models for the various housing typologies. /

The Haitian electrical power distribution grid was accessible to only about 10\% of the population before the earthquake of January 2010. Much of that infrastructure was destroyed. Practically, the Haitian grid of the future will have to grow from localized green energy farms be they photovoltaic, micro/pico hydro and/or wind. This development will require the training of a Haitian green energy work force as well as fundamentally new knowledge about design of power grids that are fundamentally variable in output. A micro-grid developed in Sud-Ouest, Haiti was devastated during Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. We have recently installed a micro-grid at are partners (ITCS) training site in southwest Haiti. We will continue monitoring as well as expanding this micro-grid. Students working with the program will assist in green energy research while interfacing with students, practitioners and researchers in Haiti. /

						<li>Sustainable sanitation systems require the functional integration of infrastructure and society; however, most studies focus on technology innovation and do not adequately account for how human behavior and social needs affect, and are affected by, sanitation systems. In resource-limited communities, sanitation systems continue to experience high failure rates. To address this gap, this research aims to elucidate the community processes (community priorities, stakeholder engagement processes, and training processes) and infrastructure designs that result in sustainable sanitation systems. Data collected from 20 communities in India will be used in the analysis. We will analyze how combined community processes and infrastructure designs affect the sustainability of sanitation and integrated sanitation and resource recovery systems using Qualitative Comparative Analysis. We will develop metrics to  evaluate the social, behavioral, and environmental impacts of sanitation and resource recovery systems in a life cycle analysis. Responsibilities will include coding and analyzing qualitative interview data, literature review, and assisting with conference and journal article authorship. /

						<li>For the decade, oil and gas development in the United States has relied on horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to extract oil and gas from shale and tight sands.  Hydraulic fracturing fluids include chemicals of concern for groundwater contamination.  Recently, some oil and gas operators have claimed to make fracturing fluids "greener" -- to replace some potentially toxic compounds with less toxic compounds.  The claims of greener fracturing fluids have not been confirmed. /  / For this study, we intend to examine trends in the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluid from 2011 to the present using publicly-available data (the "FracFocus" database).  Using the 120,000 records of hydraulic fracturing jobs across the United States, we will review use for geographical (by state, by oil and gas basin), hydrocarbon type (oil, wet gas, dry gas), and temporal trends.  The temporal trends will be adjusted for geographic and hydrocarbon differences and assessed for changes in the frequency and amount of use of chemicals of concern.

By bonding a pre-strained, thermally-responsive Shape Memory Polymer film to an elastomeric substrate of similar thickness, applying localized heat between the layers causes contraction of the SMP layer, and a bending motion of the entire bi-layer system. This project aims to study the relationship between the programming conditions of the SMP, substrate thickness, and bending curvature. Experimental results are compared to a theoretical, finite element model. This knowledge is then used to realize deployable structures through origami self-folding.

						<li>Most conventional medical stents were made from metal to keep vessel or urethra open, however, neointimal hyperplasia and smooth muscle cells accumulation are reported for bare metal stents, which leads to inflammation and turbulent blood flow. Another issue occurs when implanting the stent into the vessel. Doctors need to insert a balloon catheter into patient?s vessel during surgery, which may cause pain, damage to the tissue and even inflammation to the healthy part. Shape memory polymers (SMP), apart from the bio-inert property, offers more potentials to realize a smart and flexible bio-medical stent. In this research, we used SMP as the structure material for the stent and integrated sensors that at the same time detect the bio-condition. Currently we are working on mixing Nano-Ferro-Magnetic particles with our SMPs to achieve remotely controlling the moving of the stent and the place it fixed. Considering that we could always adjust the transition temperature by change the chemical ratio in our formula, it will be more promising to trigger the transition at a little higher than body temperature, and alternating magnetic field could adopt to heat up the stent.

New methods for combining smart materials and conductive threads allow us to create textiles that can change color and shape in response to computational data. For instance, your shirt might change its pattern upon receiving and email or a stripe could travel between your shirt and the shirt of a nearby friend. A key challenge in developing new interactive behaviors for textiles is the lack of design software for creating and simulating different interactive behaviors. Thus, I am seeking a student who can help design software interfaces for programmable knitting and weaving machines that will allow people to design and simulate various computational behaviors on fabrics. This will involve learning both about traditional fabric production techniques like weaving and knitting; learning about various "smart" materials that can be integrated into fabric; and developing deeper knowledge of electronics and circuitry.

						<li>The concept of engineering identity is a big one for engineering education researchers to  understand. Consider: Do you feel like you?re an engineer? Do you identify with the profession of engineering? Do others officially recognize you as an engineer? To what consequence?  / Beginning in the Fall 2017 semester, we are starting several exciting initiatives to better understand how the structure, environment and culture of our first-year courses impact how students are feeling about being engineers.  / In this DLA, you will work with e+ faculty to identify a research question you?d like to investigate related to concepts of identity development in the first-year of engineering undergraduate. Together we?ll design a research strategy, explore relevant background literature, then collect data related to the research question, analyze the data, and see what we can learn based on the analysis. Along the way you will gain experience designing and executing an educational research study in engineering, with potential to develop and facilitate surveys, convene focus groups and conduct interviews with enrolled engineering students.

						<li>Concrete is the most utilized construction material in the world and the second-most consumed material on Earth after water. Consequently, its production, use, and disposal has global environmental consequences. For example, the manufacture of cement alone is responsible for 5-8% of global carbon dioxide emissions. In addition to neg, concrete sequesters non-trivial amounts of CO2 via carbonation ? a chemical reaction between cement paste and CO2. This project will employ a previously validated model that predicts carbon sequestration potential of concrete and extend it to other concrete products, namely hemp-lime concrete (aka hempcrete), a novel insulation material for energy efficient buildings. The model will account for cement type and content, exposure, and time. The model will be used to investigate the effect of these factors and the influence of compressive strength and geometry, namely surface-area-to-volume (SA/V) ratio, on total carbon sequestration of hemp-lime concrete.

It is increasingly important that we prepare our new engineering graduates to quickly and effectively contribute to the engineering workplace, and capstone design courses are central to this preparation. However, research highlights the differences between that which engineers do at work and the kinds of training they receive in school. Using a multi-case approach, this investigation seeks to understand how and to what extent capstone design courses prepare students to effectively enter communities of practice in engineering workplaces. The DLA student will meet weekly with faculty and be involved in collecting and analyzing data obtained through qualitative interviews and weekly reflective workplace surveys as well as selecting the cohort for the next year of the investigation. The anticipated findings include answers to research questions regarding preparation, developed skills, and important teaching practices that enable us to better understand how students move from capstone design courses into engineering workplaces. /  /

As interfaces control the functionalities of nanomaterials, to tailor the thermoelectric efficiency of Si-Ge applications, the role of various point defects at the interfaces, and how they influence the energy transport properties is crucial. Overall, the project aims towards designing next-generation thermoelectric materials.

						<li>As electronic devices become thinner, thermal management is becoming a critical issue. And in the push for flexible electronics, traditional methods of heat removal are becoming more challenging. Our group is developing ultra thin, flexible thermal ground planes using microfabricated polymer heat pipes, as an enabling technology for future 1-mm thin smartphones. Major challenges associated with this project include hermetic sealing with atomic layer deposition (ALD) inorganic barrier films, design of flexible structures to enable a 90-degree bend without cracking, charging the microfluidic system to eliminate non-condensable gasses, and developing wicking structures with hydrophilic ALD films. Research tasks will be associated with the assembly, testing, and characterization of the thermal and fluid transport. This project will provide training in polymer device microfabrication and assembly, thermal and fluid structure characterization, and design of microsystems for thermal management.

						<li>Heat generation limits the performance of a new generation of power electronics including inverters for solar power, DC converters in data centers, solid state power amplifiers, and laser systems. In such systems, the heat flux can be 1,000 W/cm2?close to that of the surface of the sun. We are developing as methods of mitigating such ultrahigh heat loads using enhanced capillary-fed boiling in vapor chambers.  Major challenges with this project include micro/nano fabrication of capillary wick structures, improving test fixtures for high heat flux, atomic layer deposition (ALD) based encapsulation to protect the wick from harsh environments, and developing models of the heat transfer. Research tasks will be associated with the fabrication, assembly, testing, and characterization of the thermal and fluid transport, as well as corrosion-protection effectiveness of ALD films.

						<li>Climate extremes (eg wildfire, flooding, and drought) can adversely impact the nation's drinking water sources. This research aims to develop a web-based application (e.g. R Shiny: https://shiny.rstudio.com/ or Bokeh: http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) to help utilities understand their risk of experiencing one of these events. To do so, an undergraduate researcher will perform a literature review on the impact of climate extremes on water quality, perform statistical analyses on the frequency and severity of various climate extremes, and create a national risk plot for wildfires, floods, and droughts. The project will culminate in a web-based computer app that can be shared with stakeholders to aid in their understanding of risks to their systems.  This application will be paired with results from simulation models of drinking water treatment performance to help utilities understand their resilience to these events and aid in long-term decision making.  The project couples a team of professors and one or more graduate students on an EPA-funded multi-year research project.  The main advisor will be a senior graduate student who is an expert in decision support for drinking water.
