					<p>The goal of the ninja car project is to demonstrate on-board perception, planning and control algorithms for driving ground vehicles capable of dynamic “gymnastic moves” such as jumping, drifting, rolling, bouncing, tumbling or wall-driving. This capability for fast, lightweight autonomous ground vehicles is possible due to the confluence of innovative algorithms for perception, planning and control, as well as new actuators and small form factor computing. Our platform of choice is a small 1/8th scale off-road racing vehicle, modified with sensing, jump-actuation and on-board computing. Our goal is to reliably automate the execution of these dynamic, “gymnastic” maneuvers. We envision ninja cars launching off inclined surfaces, bouncing down walls, jumping through open windows, much like human parkour runners fly through urban spaces today. The question arises: where can such a novel class of vehicle actually drive?  How much of the world is accessible to this class of vehicle? These platforms will be useful in a variety of contexts including cluttered terrain navigation, long-term surveillance, and high-speed pursuit using a variety of novel control maneuvers, such as jumping.

					<p>Micro-grids for Smart Villages is a collaboration of UCB faculty, the Mortenson Center for Engineering in Developing Communities (MC-EDC), The IEEE Smart Village Program (ISV) and L’Institut Technique de la Côte-Sud (ITCS), Coteaux, Sud-Ouest, Haiti. The Haitian electrical power distribution grid was accessible to only about 10\% of the population before the earthquake of January 2010. Much of that infrastructure was destroyed. Practically, the Haitian grid of the future will have to grow from localized green energy farms be they photovoltaic, micro/pico hydro and/or wind. This development will require the training of a Haitian green energy work force as well as fundamentally new knowledge about design of power grids that are fundamentally variable in output. A micro-grid developed in Sud-Ouest, Haiti was devastated during Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. We have recently installed a micro-grid at are partners (ITCS) training site in southwest Haiti. We will continue monitoring as well as expanding this micro-grid. Students working with the program will assist in green energy research while interfacing with students, practitioners and researchers in Haiti. /

					<p>The engagement of the Mickelson group in applications of rural telecommunications (Nepal, Peru, Cameroon, Papua New Guinea (PNG)) is longstanding (a decade). The group has worked cooperatively with various Universities, NGOs, health entities, government entities and funding agencies (Venture, IEEE - Foundation, Humanitarian Activities Committee (HAC) and Smart Village (SV)) on health, education and commerce projects. The group is presently constructing a Wi-Fi Long Distance Testbed here in Boulder in order to pre-test wireless equipment before jungle/mountain installations far from home. New equipment for this highly innovative technology is constantly appearing as is simulation software. The group has also been testing innovative power supply solutions for the mainly solar powered Industry, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band installations. There is an option for students working with us here to who have interest in rural telecommunications to join us during assessment, installation and evaluation trips to distant locations.  /

					<p>Optical fiber is the chosen medium for high data rate (Gbps) interconnections that are longer than circa 10 meters. Most recently, fiber has been applied to interconnecting the rack tops of warehouse scale data centers (WSC’s). Fiber itself is only useful for point to point interconnections. Electronics distributes signals to optical modulators for multiplexing and from optical detectors for processing. Integrated optical technologies in semiconductors are becoming more sophisticated. Such technologies can be be used to integrate operations of modulation, multiplexing and switching using chip real estate almost as compact as those offered by electronics. These integrated optical technologies have yet to find widespread use in networks primarily because of problems of interconnecting them to electronics, optical fiber but more importantly in the case of data centers and supercomputers, finding a compelling need. For example, operations that are better performed optically in those data racks that are fiber optically linked together. In this work we are investigating compelling needs through modeling and experiment.

					<p>This project is focused on organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) as a biosensing platform. OECTs are used in applications ranging from measurements of epileptic activity and neuron action potentials to measurements of metabolic activity in cancerous cells. Our work is focused on the device physics and materials science of OECTs and the development of faster transistors with higher signal-to-noise ratios. Undergraduate work on this project will primarily be the optimization of novel methods for patterning organic materials. The undergraduate on this project will learn to fabricate OECTs using microfabrication techniques including photolithography, metal deposition, and reactive ion etching. Additionally, the undergraduate will learn to use characterization tools such as source-meter-units for electrical testing and contact profilometers for measurement of device dimensions and surface quality.

					<p>Crewed space exploration missions will involve humans (astronauts) interacting with complex, automated systems. For example, during future crewed planetary landings (e.g. on the moon or Mars) astronauts will be required to supervise automated landing programs and intervene by transitioning to a pilot manual control mode, if necessary. In this project we will develop advanced display concepts and novel control modes to enhance the astronaut pilot landing performance and safety. We will then test their effectiveness by performing human subject experiments in our spacecraft cockpit simulator. We measure human responses, such as workload and situational awareness, as well a overall system performance. Responsibilities will include developing software for experiments (particularly MATLAB and Simulink), performing human subject testing, and analyzing data.

					<p>We are investigating how computing students pick up and engage with software engineering practices during their bachelors degree. In particular, we want to understand how coursework supports their professional identity development during the school-to-work transition. To achieve this, we have previously conducted interviews with students early in their CS senior project experience and at the conclusion of their senior project experience. Next steps may include conducting interviews with students during their junior year, observations of current seniors on their projects, and with graduates of the CS program from the past few years. Conducting interviews and analyzing responses for patterns will be performed. /  / In addition, we are interested in designing surveys to automatically collect information about how students actually value and make use of software engineering practices. Why do students not make use of best practices during their coursework? How does valuing best practices connect to development of a professional identity and a sense of belonging in the computing profession? Data analysis of survey responses will inform answers to these questions.

					<h4 align = "left">Description</h4>
					<p>This project uses computer simulations to optimize the location of groundwater monitoring wells to properly characterize the effectiveness of in situ remediation of contaminated groundwater.  During in situ groundwater remediation, a chemical or biological amendment is introduced into a contaminant plume to react with and degrade the contaminant.  The reactions occur at the contact area between the amendment and contaminant plumes.  We have developed a novel method that uses time-varying flow fields to increase the contact area and enhance degradation.  The effectiveness of the method has been demonstrated through computer simulations, which solve for concentrations of contaminant, amendment, and reaction product throughout the domain.  In a field setting, however, concentration data can only be collected at a finite number of wells, whose locations must be chosen strategically to maximize the amount of useful information available to evaluate the effectiveness of the method. The purpose of this project is to identify the set of optimal well locations that balances the tradeoff between maximizing the information obtained and minimizing cost.

					<p>This research project explores the future of textiles, the materials that make up clothes, drapery and upholstery. New methods for combining smart materials and conductive threads allow us to create textiles that can change color and shape in response to computational data. For instance, your shirt might change its pattern upon receiving and email or a stripe could travel between your shirt and the shirt of a nearby friend. A key challenge in developing new interactive behaviors for textiles is the lack of design software for creating and simulating different interactive behaviors. Thus, I am seeking a student who can help design software interfaces for programmable knitting and weaving machines that will allow people to design and simulate various computational behaviors on fabrics. This will involve learning both about traditional fabric production techniques like weaving and knitting; learning about various "smart" materials that can be integrated into fabric; and developing deeper knowledge of electronics and circuitry. This position will require both hands on construction of smart textiles as well as software work.  /  /

					<p>Perceptual learning is the technique of showing many training instances to a human learner, usually in visual manner, and forcing the learner to make a prediction/label while providing feedback. When done appropriately, this can develop a gut instinct in the learner, which appears to be how many human experts operate (i.e., a chess master can glance at a chess board and quickly form a first impression about the strength of a position; a forester can glance at a far-off tree and guess the species).  There is some software to automate this, called perceptual learning modules (PLM), but these PLM require the user to input a training set of labeled images which is clearly very time consuming. This project would create a PLM website that uses google image search to automatically generate the training set, so that the user specifies only the labels (such as “pine tree” and “spruce tree”) and the website generates corresponding training images. Students must be comfortable with web programming (accessing data via API’s, and building dynamic webpages).

					<p>The goal of the ninja car project is to demonstrate on-board perception, planning and control algorithms for driving ground vehicles capable of dynamic “gymnastic moves” such as jumping, drifting, rolling, bouncing, tumbling or wall-driving. This capability for fast, lightweight autonomous ground vehicles is possible due to the confluence of innovative algorithms for perception, planning and control, as well as new actuators and small form factor computing. Our platform of choice is a small 1/8th scale off-road racing vehicle, modified with sensing, jump-actuation and on-board computing. Our goal is to reliably automate the execution of these dynamic, “gymnastic” maneuvers. We envision ninja cars launching off inclined surfaces, bouncing down walls, jumping through open windows, much like human parkour runners fly through urban spaces today. The question arises: where can such a novel class of vehicle actually drive? How much of the world is accessible to this class of vehicle? These platforms will be useful in a variety of contexts including cluttered terrain navigation, long-term surveillance, and high-speed pursuit using a variety of novel control maneuvers, such as jumping.

					<p>The popularity of devices like FitBits and other fitness trackers as a way to collect data about everyday activities (steps, calories burned, distance traveled) have changed how we think about the kinds of data that can be collected from our "everyday" activities and used to self-reflect about what makes us happier, healthier, more productive, or more stressed. These kinds of "trace data" can also be collected about other activities that we undertake during the course of a typical day -- for example, the ways that we work with our computers and mobile devices, the information that we share with others, the places that we go when we're working (and not), and our patterns of working time and leisure time. All of these bits of information help to paint a picture about how we get things done a day-to-day basis, with whom, and when our "getting things done" is making us happy...and when it isn't. In this project, a DLA apprentice will work with an interdisciplinary INFO/CS research group to build tools that will collect data about the when, where, who, and with-whom that information work takes place, as well as dashboards to help people make sense of these everyday activity "traces."
				</p>
				</div>
				<div style="width:38%;float:left;">
					<h4 align = "left">Requirements</h4>
					<p>
						Since the development of these kinds of trace data loggers requires connecting to sometimes-complex computing systems (e.g., web service APIs, computer and mobile device operating systems, etc.), a junior- or senior-level student in computer science (or similar discipline) would be the best fit for this work. Having completed—with reasonable grades!—any combination of CSCI 3002, CSCI 3287, CSCI 3753, CSCI 4273, and/or CSCI 4448 (or equivalents) would be a plus. (Mature and self-directed lower-division students with evidence of independent development experience would also be considered!)

					<p>With an aging population research regarding cognitive, developmental and physical disabilities is becoming increasingly important.  People with disabilities is a very underserved population and many of the clients have client specific needs that can not be met with available or affordable technology or devices. While my students do research and design for a specific client there are usually others out there who can use a similar low-cost device.   /  / I want to follow up with the clients and understand details of their use of the research and how it impacts their lives.  The student would help to write up the research in journals so that other people with special needs have access to the research we have done.

					<p>The purpose of this DLA project is to study the experiences and perceptions of individuals as they move from capstone courses into workplaces. It is increasingly important that we prepare our new engineering graduates to quickly and effectively contribute to the engineering workplace, and capstone design courses are central to this preparation. However, research highlights the differences between that which engineers do at work and the kinds of training they receive in school. Using a multi-case approach, this investigation seeks to understand how and to what extent capstone design courses prepare students to effectively enter communities of practice in engineering workplaces. The DLA student will meet weekly with faculty and be involved in collecting and analyzing data obtained through qualitative interviews and weekly reflective workplace surveys as well as selecting the cohort for the next year of the investigation. The anticipated findings include answers to research questions regarding preparation, developed skills, and important teaching practices that enable us to better understand how students move from capstone design courses into engineering workplaces. /  /

					<p>Current analysis systems suffer from a significant gap between the times and places data is collected and when and where it is analyzed. This project explores how people might take advantage of mobile technologies and augmented reality to bridge this gap. /  / Students on this project will develop web-based or Android-based applications for mobile data collection leveraging cloud storage and compute technologies. They will also design and and develop augmented reality applications and visualizations for analyzing collected data in context.  /  / Students should have prior programming experience. Experience with mobile development, databases, visualization, or augmented reality are a plus.

					<p>How do Twitter users feel about researchers using their tweets? How does the public react to social computing research? How do researchers understand Terms of Service that might relate to their research practices, e.g., around data scraping? There are three potential methodological directions for this project, depending on the skillset of interested student: (1) collecting and analyzing Twitter (and potentially other public) data; (2) qualitative content analysis of news articles and/or Terms of Service; and (3) survey creation and analysis.

					<p>The ability to create and express oneself with technology is important for full participation in today’s digitally society. Many toys and kits have emerged for children to code or to create and express themselves with technology. However, these toys and kits often focus on children 8 years old and up. Toys that are available for young children to learn to code are often expensive or narrow in what can be done with them. In this project, we'll play-test existing toys to examine the space of what exists and imagine what's possible by developing new prototypes.

					<p>Why are algorithms cruel? Products like Timehop, Facebook’s “On This Day” and “Lookback”, and Google Photo’s “Remember This Day” present us with photos, status updates, and events from our pasts with the opportunity to revisit past experiences. But these algorithms also remind you of bad breakups, serious injuries, and the deaths of loved ones. At best, negative memories are the annoying byproduct of ignorant algorithms. At worst, they are traumatic.  /  / Students in this project will explore how we can design more compassionate algorithms using a combination of computational social science, systems building, and user studies. Ideal students will have taken courses in dev ops, algorithms, HCI, or HCC, and have an interest in big data and the design of social technologies.

					<p>Love JavaScript?  Hate that there are few development tools for it?  Dynamic languages like JavaScript are extremely flexible leading to a proliferation of very powerful frameworks.  At the same, this flexibility is what makes tools for these languages so difficult to build and so poor in general.  The goal of this project is to codify the idioms that framework developers use in the form of types or other kinds of specifications and design tools and checkers that support these idiomatic uses of dynamic languages.
