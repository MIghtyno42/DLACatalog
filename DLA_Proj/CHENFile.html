					<p>The purpose of the project is to use atomic layer deposition (ALD) to coat aluminum nitride (AlN) particles with yttrium oxide sintering aid, to synthesize a colloidal gel using these coated particles, and to 3D print an optimized UV-LED heat sink from the gel, which is then fired into a dense part and tested for heat transfer.  AlN is highly thermally conductive, is an electrical insulator and is unaffected structurally by UV light.   The benefit of the project is to improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of UV-LED lighting through effective heat removal and minimized AlN use (part design).  The PI's lab is expert in ALD and non-oxide ceramic materials and developed this concept in response to a recognized need for UV-LED heat removal.  3D printing will Increase design freedom & provide the ability to design more functional parts (perform better with lattice structures not possible to incorporate by conventional processing).  ALD allows for improved fabricated ceramic parts with reduced flaw size.

					<p>"Cobalt atomic layer deposition (ALD) has been used previously in our lab to synthesize cobalt/Al2O3 catalysts highly active for Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS). This activity has been attributed to a cobalt morphology novel to both ALD and FTS; namely that cobalt is depositing epitaxially on the crystalline regions of the Al2O3 surface and creating cobalt monolayers. We believe that altering the Al2O3 support will allow us to control the cobalt deposition process during ALD and ultimately increase the activity of these catalysts for FTS. Undergraduate work will consist primarily of assisting in the catalyst synthesis process via Al2O3 modification, ALD system building/use, and testing these catalysts in the FTS reactors. This work will be followed by FTS product/activity analysis using a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer with possible additional work with surface characterization techniques such as temperature programmed reduction and chemisorption." /  / Evaluation will be that you will present a research review at the end of the spring semester and write up a letter report. /  /

					<p>An ideal redox material (which drives the process) to split water using concentrated sunlight has not yet been developed. Hence, this project has the goal of developing new spinel and perovskite metal oxide materials (Ph.D. student supervisor) having ideal thermodynamic, kinetic, and long-term reactivity. The U/G student will synthesize materials using a citrate gel process, characterize the materials using XRD, BET, ICP, and SEM, and test materials in a well-instrumented stagnation flow reactor at CU to measure hydrogen production capacity and reaction rates; and work with the Ph.D. student to develop reaction rate expressions for both oxidation and reduction steps. Our research group is the largest academic solarthermal research team in the U.S.   Key to ultimate project success is the discovery of robust materials that have high H2 productivity per mass of active material and can redox (reduction/oxidation) indefinitely without deactivation.  The Ph.D. student is supported by the NSF and her objective is to discover new materials using atomistic modeling (density functional theory) from nearly 2000 possibilities of perovskites and doped spinels.  The U/G DLA will support her.

					<p>Micro-grids for Smart Villages is a collaboration of UCB faculty, the Mortenson Center for Engineering in Developing Communities (MC-EDC), The IEEE Smart Village Program (ISV) and L’Institut Technique de la Côte-Sud (ITCS), Coteaux, Sud-Ouest, Haiti. The Haitian electrical power distribution grid was accessible to only about 10\% of the population before the earthquake of January 2010. Much of that infrastructure was destroyed. Practically, the Haitian grid of the future will have to grow from localized green energy farms be they photovoltaic, micro/pico hydro and/or wind. This development will require the training of a Haitian green energy work force as well as fundamentally new knowledge about design of power grids that are fundamentally variable in output. A micro-grid developed in Sud-Ouest, Haiti was devastated during Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. We have recently installed a micro-grid at are partners (ITCS) training site in southwest Haiti. We will continue monitoring as well as expanding this micro-grid. Students working with the program will assist in green energy research while interfacing with students, practitioners and researchers in Haiti. /

					<p>The engagement of the Mickelson group in applications of rural telecommunications (Nepal, Peru, Cameroon, Papua New Guinea (PNG)) is longstanding (a decade). The group has worked cooperatively with various Universities, NGOs, health entities, government entities and funding agencies (Venture, IEEE - Foundation, Humanitarian Activities Committee (HAC) and Smart Village (SV)) on health, education and commerce projects. The group is presently constructing a Wi-Fi Long Distance Testbed here in Boulder in order to pre-test wireless equipment before jungle/mountain installations far from home. New equipment for this highly innovative technology is constantly appearing as is simulation software. The group has also been testing innovative power supply solutions for the mainly solar powered Industry, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band installations. There is an option for students working with us here to who have interest in rural telecommunications to join us during assessment, installation and evaluation trips to distant locations.  /

					<p>This project is focused on organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) as a biosensing platform. OECTs are used in applications ranging from measurements of epileptic activity and neuron action potentials to measurements of metabolic activity in cancerous cells. Our work is focused on the device physics and materials science of OECTs and the development of faster transistors with higher signal-to-noise ratios. Undergraduate work on this project will primarily be the optimization of novel methods for patterning organic materials. The undergraduate on this project will learn to fabricate OECTs using microfabrication techniques including photolithography, metal deposition, and reactive ion etching. Additionally, the undergraduate will learn to use characterization tools such as source-meter-units for electrical testing and contact profilometers for measurement of device dimensions and surface quality.

					<p>Sustainable sanitation systems require the functional integration of infrastructure and society; however, most studies focus on technology innovation and do not adequately account for how human behavior and social needs affect, and are affected by, sanitation systems. In resource-limited communities, sanitation systems continue to experience high failure rates. To address this gap, this research aims to elucidate the community processes (community priorities, stakeholder engagement processes, and training processes) and infrastructure designs that result in sustainable sanitation systems. Data collected from 20 communities in India will be used in the analysis. We will analyze how combined community processes and infrastructure designs affect the sustainability of sanitation and integrated sanitation and resource recovery systems using Qualitative Comparative Analysis. We will develop metrics to  evaluate the social, behavioral, and environmental impacts of sanitation and resource recovery systems in a life cycle analysis. Responsibilities will include coding and analyzing qualitative interview data, literature review, and assisting with conference and journal article authorship. /

					<p>For the decade, oil and gas development in the United States has relied on horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to extract oil and gas from shale and tight sands.  Hydraulic fracturing fluids include chemicals of concern for groundwater contamination.  Recently, some oil and gas operators have claimed to make fracturing fluids "greener" -- to replace some potentially toxic compounds with less toxic compounds.  The claims of greener fracturing fluids have not been confirmed. /  / For this study, we intend to examine trends in the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluid from 2011 to the present using publicly-available data (the "FracFocus" database).  Using the 120,000 records of hydraulic fracturing jobs across the United States, we will review use for geographical (by state, by oil and gas basin), hydrocarbon type (oil, wet gas, dry gas), and temporal trends.  The temporal trends will be adjusted for geographic and hydrocarbon differences and assessed for changes in the frequency and amount of use of chemicals of concern.

					<p>Shape-Memory Polymers (SMPs) have unique properties that allow them to alter their shape in response to specific stimuli. By bonding a pre-strained, thermally-responsive Shape Memory Polymer film to an elastomeric substrate of similar thickness, applying localized heat between the layers causes contraction of the SMP layer, and a bending motion of the entire bi-layer system. This project aims to study the relationship between the programming conditions of the SMP, substrate thickness, and bending curvature. Experimental results are compared to a theoretical, finite element model. This knowledge is then used to realize deployable structures through origami self-folding.

					<p>Most conventional medical stents were made from metal to keep vessel or urethra open, however, neointimal hyperplasia and smooth muscle cells accumulation are reported for bare metal stents, which leads to inflammation and turbulent blood flow. Another issue occurs when implanting the stent into the vessel. Doctors need to insert a balloon catheter into patient’s vessel during surgery, which may cause pain, damage to the tissue and even inflammation to the healthy part. Shape memory polymers (SMP), apart from the bio-inert property, offers more potentials to realize a smart and flexible bio-medical stent. In this research, we used SMP as the structure material for the stent and integrated sensors that at the same time detect the bio-condition. Currently we are working on mixing Nano-Ferro-Magnetic particles with our SMPs to achieve remotely controlling the moving of the stent and the place it fixed. Considering that we could always adjust the transition temperature by change the chemical ratio in our formula, it will be more promising to trigger the transition at a little higher than body temperature, and alternating magnetic field could adopt to heat up the stent.
