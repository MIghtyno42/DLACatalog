					<p>Sustainable sanitation systems require the functional integration of infrastructure and society; however, most studies focus on technology innovation and do not adequately account for how human behavior and social needs affect, and are affected by, sanitation systems. In resource-limited communities, sanitation systems continue to experience high failure rates. To address this gap, this research aims to elucidate the community processes (community priorities, stakeholder engagement processes, and training processes) and infrastructure designs that result in sustainable sanitation systems. Data collected from 20 communities in India will be used in the analysis. We will analyze how combined community processes and infrastructure designs affect the sustainability of sanitation and integrated sanitation and resource recovery systems using Qualitative Comparative Analysis. We will develop metrics to  evaluate the social, behavioral, and environmental impacts of sanitation and resource recovery systems in a life cycle analysis. Responsibilities will include coding and analyzing qualitative interview data, literature review, and assisting with conference and journal article authorship. /

					<h4 align = "left">Description</h4>
					<p>For the decade, oil and gas development in the United States has relied on horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to extract oil and gas from shale and tight sands.  Hydraulic fracturing fluids include chemicals of concern for groundwater contamination.  Recently, some oil and gas operators have claimed to make fracturing fluids "greener" -- to replace some potentially toxic compounds with less toxic compounds.  The claims of greener fracturing fluids have not been confirmed. /  / For this study, we intend to examine trends in the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluid from 2011 to the present using publicly-available data (the "FracFocus" database).  Using the 120,000 records of hydraulic fracturing jobs across the United States, we will review use for geographical (by state, by oil and gas basin), hydrocarbon type (oil, wet gas, dry gas), and temporal trends.  The temporal trends will be adjusted for geographic and hydrocarbon differences and assessed for changes in the frequency and amount of use of chemicals of concern.

					<p>The student will work closely with three PhD students on a project that seeks to understand how WASH systems can be analyzed, strengthened and measured for a USAID learning project that is being implemented across four country contexts in collaboration with seven implementing partner organizations.  / The DLA will assist with systems and WASH literature review and synthesis of approaches, tools, indicators and general systems theory. This will include supporting text for publication and understanding of the state of-art of the field.  / The DLA will also be involved with analyzing systems modeling approaches to assist with answering research and learning questions across the project.  /

					<h4 align = "left">Description</h4>
					<p>An increasing number of governments and aid organizations are choosing to relocate affected communities, transferring them to less geographically risky sites, after a major disaster hits. However, relocation often has harmful socioeconomic side effects and fails to separate people from the original, and new, hazards. Many civil engineering and construction decisions throughout relocation project implementation are influential in the overall risk experienced by community members.  / This research focuses on the relocation of over 16,000 families displaced when Tyhpoon Haiyan tore through Tacloban City, Philippines, in November 2013. Based on fieldwork conducted in Tacloban City for five months in 2016 and future fieldwork in late 2017, the Discovery Learning Apprentice will work closely with research team to build indicators for holistic risk reduction and use them to assess project outcomes at 12 relocation sites in Tacloban City. The student will learn and work closely with NVivo software and Qualitative Comparative Analysis.  /

						An interest in learning a variety of methods to collect and analysis qualitative and quantitative data including: qualitative interviewing, qualitative coding with NVivo, survey development, factor analysis, and qualitative comparative analysis. Must be able to work well both independently and on teams, including international teams as it’s likely we will hire and collaboratively work with a local research assistant in the Philippines for much of the 2017-2018 school year. A demonstrated interest in engineering for developing communities or disaster recovery work is preferred.  /
