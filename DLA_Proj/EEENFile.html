						<li>In urban environments, infrastructure components are not isolated. Due to their close proximity, they interact with one another during earthquakes by affecting the static and dynamic stresses in the underlying interface soil. The research objective is to identify the key predictors of the performance of a building cluster on softened ground by: (1) performing centrifuge experiments to fundamentally evaluate multiple structure-soil-structure interaction on liquefiable ground and the impact and relative importance of the properties of building, ground motion, mitigation strategy, and cluster on the EDPs of structure and surrounding soil; (2) developing validated nonlinear numerical models of the coupled structure-soil-structure systems that are studied experimentally; and (3) performing a preliminary parametric study with the calibrated numerical models to define the most efficient ground motion predicting parameters of the performance of building clusters on softened ground. The undergraduate student involved in this project will be heavily involved in centrifuge modeling and data processing/visualization component of this research.

						<li>The goal of the ninja car project is to demonstrate on-board perception, planning and control algorithms for driving ground vehicles capable of dynamic ?gymnastic moves? such as jumping, drifting, rolling, bouncing, tumbling or wall-driving. This capability for fast, lightweight autonomous ground vehicles is possible due to the confluence of innovative algorithms for perception, planning and control, as well as new actuators and small form factor computing. Our platform of choice is a small 1/8th scale off-road racing vehicle, modified with sensing, jump-actuation and on-board computing. Our goal is to reliably automate the execution of these dynamic, ?gymnastic? maneuvers. We envision ninja cars launching off inclined surfaces, bouncing down walls, jumping through open windows, much like human parkour runners fly through urban spaces today. The question arises: where can such a novel class of vehicle actually drive?  How much of the world is accessible to this class of vehicle? These platforms will be useful in a variety of contexts including cluttered terrain navigation, long-term surveillance, and high-speed pursuit using a variety of novel control maneuvers, such as jumping.

The Haitian electrical power distribution grid was accessible to only about 10\% of the population before the earthquake of January 2010. Much of that infrastructure was destroyed. Practically, the Haitian grid of the future will have to grow from localized green energy farms be they photovoltaic, micro/pico hydro and/or wind. This development will require the training of a Haitian green energy work force as well as fundamentally new knowledge about design of power grids that are fundamentally variable in output. A micro-grid developed in Sud-Ouest, Haiti was devastated during Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. We have recently installed a micro-grid at are partners (ITCS) training site in southwest Haiti. We will continue monitoring as well as expanding this micro-grid. Students working with the program will assist in green energy research while interfacing with students, practitioners and researchers in Haiti. /

						<li>Optical fiber is the chosen medium for high data rate (Gbps) interconnections that are longer than circa 10 meters. Most recently, fiber has been applied to interconnecting the rack tops of warehouse scale data centers (WSC?s). Fiber itself is only useful for point to point interconnections. Electronics distributes signals to optical modulators for multiplexing and from optical detectors for processing. Integrated optical technologies in semiconductors are becoming more sophisticated. Such technologies can be be used to integrate operations of modulation, multiplexing and switching using chip real estate almost as compact as those offered by electronics. These integrated optical technologies have yet to find widespread use in networks primarily because of problems of interconnecting them to electronics, optical fiber but more importantly in the case of data centers and supercomputers, finding a compelling need. For example, operations that are better performed optically in those data racks that are fiber optically linked together. In this work we are investigating compelling needs through modeling and experiment.

						<li>Shape-Memory Polymers (SMPs) have unique properties that allow them to alter their shape in response to specific stimuli. By bonding a pre-strained, thermally-responsive Shape Memory Polymer film to an elastomeric substrate of similar thickness, applying localized heat between the layers causes contraction of the SMP layer, and a bending motion of the entire bi-layer system. This project aims to study the relationship between the programming conditions of the SMP, substrate thickness, and bending curvature. Experimental results are compared to a theoretical, finite element model. This knowledge is then used to realize deployable structures through origami self-folding.

						<li>Most conventional medical stents were made from metal to keep vessel or urethra open, however, neointimal hyperplasia and smooth muscle cells accumulation are reported for bare metal stents, which leads to inflammation and turbulent blood flow. Another issue occurs when implanting the stent into the vessel. Doctors need to insert a balloon catheter into patient?s vessel during surgery, which may cause pain, damage to the tissue and even inflammation to the healthy part. Shape memory polymers (SMP), apart from the bio-inert property, offers more potentials to realize a smart and flexible bio-medical stent. In this research, we used SMP as the structure material for the stent and integrated sensors that at the same time detect the bio-condition. Currently we are working on mixing Nano-Ferro-Magnetic particles with our SMPs to achieve remotely controlling the moving of the stent and the place it fixed. Considering that we could always adjust the transition temperature by change the chemical ratio in our formula, it will be more promising to trigger the transition at a little higher than body temperature, and alternating magnetic field could adopt to heat up the stent.

A key challenge in developing new interactive behaviors for textiles is the lack of design software for creating and simulating different interactive behaviors. Thus, I am seeking a student who can help design software interfaces for programmable knitting and weaving machines that will allow people to design and simulate various computational behaviors on fabrics.

						<li>Perceptual learning is the technique of showing many training instances to a human learner, usually in visual manner, and forcing the learner to make a prediction/label while providing feedback. When done appropriately, this can develop a gut instinct in the learner, which appears to be how many human experts operate (i.e., a chess master can glance at a chess board and quickly form a first impression about the strength of a position; a forester can glance at a far-off tree and guess the species).  There is some software to automate this, called perceptual learning modules (PLM), but these PLM require the user to input a training set of labeled images which is clearly very time consuming. This project would create a PLM website that uses google image search to automatically generate the training set, so that the user specifies only the labels (such as ?pine tree? and ?spruce tree?) and the website generates corresponding training images. Students must be comfortable with web programming (accessing data via API?s, and building dynamic webpages).

						<li>The goal of the ninja car project is to demonstrate on-board perception, planning and control algorithms for driving ground vehicles capable of dynamic ?gymnastic moves? such as jumping, drifting, rolling, bouncing, tumbling or wall-driving. This capability for fast, lightweight autonomous ground vehicles is possible due to the confluence of innovative algorithms for perception, planning and control, as well as new actuators and small form factor computing. Our platform of choice is a small 1/8th scale off-road racing vehicle, modified with sensing, jump-actuation and on-board computing. Our goal is to reliably automate the execution of these dynamic, ?gymnastic? maneuvers. We envision ninja cars launching off inclined surfaces, bouncing down walls, jumping through open windows, much like human parkour runners fly through urban spaces today. The question arises: where can such a novel class of vehicle actually drive? How much of the world is accessible to this class of vehicle? These platforms will be useful in a variety of contexts including cluttered terrain navigation, long-term surveillance, and high-speed pursuit using a variety of novel control maneuvers, such as jumping.

						<li>The student will carry out simulations and experiments on charge transport in organic and hybrid organometallic materials of relevance to photovoltaic and other optoelectronic devices.  Computational simulations will involve writing and debugging C programs for carrying Monte Carlo simulations of charge carrier movement in the materials. Introductory work on quantum chemical calculations of electronic wave functions may also be carried out. The simulation work will be carried out on desktop workstations as well as potentially on high performance computer clusters. Additionally, some  experimental work will be carried out that involves fabrication of thin film devices and characterization of their electronic properties. The experimental work will involve use of precision source measurement units, capacitance measurement units, and nanosecond pulsed laser. Training on simulation techniques and all experimental apparatuses will be carried out by members of the Shaheen group.

						<li>This research aims to decipher the interplay between the microstructural length scales intrinsic to granular geomaterials and the wave transmission characteristics of such media over a wide frequency spectrum. In this spirit, the proposed developments are focused on examining the dispersion and attenuation of longitudinal (and flexural) waves in soil specimens of various composition. An experimental setup is proposed where a cylindrical sample of dried soil is held between a pair of source/receiver transducers under a prescribed static prestress. The (source) transducer is excited by a narrow-band modulated 5-cycle sine burst with carrier frequency fc and bandwidth 0.1fc. Thus-induced wave motion in soil is captured (a) by the (receiver) transducer, and (b) via either a high- speed camera (available in the Geotechnical Centrifuge Lab). The specimen is a periodic assembly of unit cells comprised of a certain composition of soil grains, which may be manufactured (a) by encasing the soil assembly in a plastic wrap of infinitesimal thickness, and (b) via sequential processing where (dry) soil particles are first assembled in a suitable container; the sample is then saturated (either by water or meta-cellulose) and subsequently oven-baked; thus-obtained (dried) column of soil retains its shape for the purpose of dynamical testing. A high-fidelity algorithm rooted in Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is then developed aiming to map the image sequences captured by the high-speed camera into the particle velocity distribution (in time and space) on the soil surface. A cross-correlation technique is invoked to determine the phase shift between the measured signals at multiple scan points, that is eventually used to estimate the phase velocity at a given carrier frequency fc. In this setting, the dispersion curves are constructed experimentally by repeating the measurements over a desired span of carrier frequencies fc. The results will be used to validate the outcome of the analytical and computational campaigns in progress parallel to the development of the experimental side. Interested students will experience hands-on experiments on wave phenomena, and learn advanced signal/image processing methods as universal data-processing tools. The fun part of this project is its very interdisciplinary nature.

						<li>Silicon-germanium interfaces are one of the most widely studied interfaces due to their potential applications as thermoelectric materials in several energy conversion devices (e.g., multi-mission radioisotope generators in space missions). While several studies have addressed these systems, a clear understanding regarding the precise role of interfaces in nanostructured Si-Ge materials is not yet available. As interfaces control the functionalities of nanomaterials, to tailor the thermoelectric efficiency of Si-Ge applications, the role of various point defects at the interfaces, and how they influence the energy transport properties is crucial. Overall, the project aims towards designing next-generation thermoelectric materials.

						<li>As electronic devices become thinner, thermal management is becoming a critical issue. And in the push for flexible electronics, traditional methods of heat removal are becoming more challenging. Our group is developing ultra thin, flexible thermal ground planes using microfabricated polymer heat pipes, as an enabling technology for future 1-mm thin smartphones. Major challenges associated with this project include hermetic sealing with atomic layer deposition (ALD) inorganic barrier films, design of flexible structures to enable a 90-degree bend without cracking, charging the microfluidic system to eliminate non-condensable gasses, and developing wicking structures with hydrophilic ALD films. Research tasks will be associated with the assembly, testing, and characterization of the thermal and fluid transport. This project will provide training in polymer device microfabrication and assembly, thermal and fluid structure characterization, and design of microsystems for thermal management.

						<li>Heat generation limits the performance of a new generation of power electronics including inverters for solar power, DC converters in data centers, solid state power amplifiers, and laser systems. In such systems, the heat flux can be 1,000 W/cm2?close to that of the surface of the sun. We are developing as methods of mitigating such ultrahigh heat loads using enhanced capillary-fed boiling in vapor chambers.  Major challenges with this project include micro/nano fabrication of capillary wick structures, improving test fixtures for high heat flux, atomic layer deposition (ALD) based encapsulation to protect the wick from harsh environments, and developing models of the heat transfer. Research tasks will be associated with the fabrication, assembly, testing, and characterization of the thermal and fluid transport, as well as corrosion-protection effectiveness of ALD films.

						<li>The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) is a constellation of satellites operated by the United States Air Force.  Three of the DMSP space environment instruments measure 1) local electric fields; 2) local magnetic fields; and 3) plasma particle flux in Low Earth Orbit. These data are available at two institutions: the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) and the NASA OMNIweb data base. We are interested in joining the data bases from the institutions to estimate energy deposition into the upper atmosphere along the satellite track.  Of particular interest is the relative location of energy being deposited by fields alone (Poynting flux) and by particles alone. Most energy seems to be coming into the auroral zones, however some recent investigations suggest that significant energy is coming into the polar cap.  This project will investigate how the energy deposition varies as the space atmosphere interaction region experiences different kinds of ?forcing? due to disturbances propagating from the Sun.  /
