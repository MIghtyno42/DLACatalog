						<p>An increasing number of governments and aid organizations are choosing to relocate affected communities, transferring them to less geographically risky sites, after a major disaster hits. However, relocation often has harmful socioeconomic side effects and fails to separate people from the original, and new, hazards. Many civil engineering and construction decisions throughout relocation project implementation are influential in the overall risk experienced by community members.  / This research focuses on the relocation of over 16,000 families displaced when Tyhpoon Haiyan tore through Tacloban City, Philippines, in November 2013. Based on fieldwork conducted in Tacloban City for five months in 2016 and future fieldwork in late 2017, the Discovery Learning Apprentice will work closely with research team to build indicators for holistic risk reduction and use them to assess project outcomes at 12 relocation sites in Tacloban City. The student will learn and work closely with NVivo software and Qualitative Comparative Analysis.  /

						<p>This research project explores the future of textiles, the materials that make up clothes, drapery and upholstery. New methods for combining smart materials and conductive threads allow us to create textiles that can change color and shape in response to computational data. For instance, your shirt might change its pattern upon receiving and email or a stripe could travel between your shirt and the shirt of a nearby friend. A key challenge in developing new interactive behaviors for textiles is the lack of design software for creating and simulating different interactive behaviors. Thus, I am seeking a student who can help design software interfaces for programmable knitting and weaving machines that will allow people to design and simulate various computational behaviors on fabrics. This will involve learning both about traditional fabric production techniques like weaving and knitting; learning about various "smart" materials that can be integrated into fabric; and developing deeper knowledge of electronics and circuitry. This position will require both hands on construction of smart textiles as well as software work.  /  /

						<p>Concrete is the most utilized construction material in the world and the second-most consumed material on Earth after water. Consequently, its production, use, and disposal has global environmental consequences. For example, the manufacture of cement alone is responsible for 5-8% of global carbon dioxide emissions. In addition to neg, concrete sequesters non-trivial amounts of CO2 via carbonation – a chemical reaction between cement paste and CO2. This project will employ a previously validated model that predicts carbon sequestration potential of concrete and extend it to other concrete products, namely hemp-lime concrete (aka hempcrete), a novel insulation material for energy efficient buildings. The model will account for cement type and content, exposure, and time. The model will be used to investigate the effect of these factors and the influence of compressive strength and geometry, namely surface-area-to-volume (SA/V) ratio, on total carbon sequestration of hemp-lime concrete.

Data collected from 20 communities in India will be used in the analysis.

						<p>Micro-grids for Smart Villages is a collaboration of UCB faculty, the Mortenson Center for Engineering in Developing Communities (MC-EDC), The IEEE Smart Village Program (ISV) and L’Institut Technique de la Côte-Sud (ITCS), Coteaux, Sud-Ouest, Haiti. The Haitian electrical power distribution grid was accessible to only about 10\% of the population before the earthquake of January 2010. Much of that infrastructure was destroyed. Practically, the Haitian grid of the future will have to grow from localized green energy farms be they photovoltaic, micro/pico hydro and/or wind. This development will require the training of a Haitian green energy work force as well as fundamentally new knowledge about design of power grids that are fundamentally variable in output. A micro-grid developed in Sud-Ouest, Haiti was devastated during Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. We have recently installed a micro-grid at are partners (ITCS) training site in southwest Haiti. We will continue monitoring as well as expanding this micro-grid. Students working with the program will assist in green energy research while interfacing with students, practitioners and researchers in Haiti. /

						<p>Coastal Ecuador experienced a magnitude 7.8 earthquake on April 16, 2016, destroying thousands of homes. In the aftermath of the earthquake, national and local governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are assisting communities repair and rebuild homes. As a part of this project, we are trying to understand how community members participate in housing reconstruction, how reconstructed houses will perform in a future hazard event, and how participation and performance impact community resilience. In the coming year, we will be examining participation and performance specifically. The graduate research assistant (GRA) will be performing observations, conducting interviews, collecting documents, and taking measurements to accrue data on community participation in the planning, design, and construction of post-disaster housing as well as the design and construction quality. The DLA can expect to assist in the analysis of this data with such tasks as qualitative coding of interview transcripts, calibration of data for qualitative comparative analysis, and the creation of structural models for the various housing typologies. /

						<p>Climate extremes (eg wildfire, flooding, and drought) can adversely impact the nation's drinking water sources. This research aims to develop a web-based application (e.g. R Shiny: https://shiny.rstudio.com/ or Bokeh: http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) to help utilities understand their risk of experiencing one of these events. To do so, an undergraduate researcher will perform a literature review on the impact of climate extremes on water quality, perform statistical analyses on the frequency and severity of various climate extremes, and create a national risk plot for wildfires, floods, and droughts. The project will culminate in a web-based computer app that can be shared with stakeholders to aid in their understanding of risks to their systems.  This application will be paired with results from simulation models of drinking water treatment performance to help utilities understand their resilience to these events and aid in long-term decision making.  The project couples a team of professors and one or more graduate students on an EPA-funded multi-year research project.  The main advisor will be a senior graduate student who is an expert in decision support for drinking water.

						<p>With an aging population research regarding cognitive, developmental and physical disabilities is becoming increasingly important.

						<p>The purpose of this DLA project is to study the experiences and perceptions of individuals as they move from capstone courses into workplaces. It is increasingly important that we prepare our new engineering graduates to quickly and effectively contribute to the engineering workplace, and capstone design courses are central to this preparation. However, research highlights the differences between that which engineers do at work and the kinds of training they receive in school. Using a multi-case approach, this investigation seeks to understand how and to what extent capstone design courses prepare students to effectively enter communities of practice in engineering workplaces. The DLA student will meet weekly with faculty and be involved in collecting and analyzing data obtained through qualitative interviews and weekly reflective workplace surveys as well as selecting the cohort for the next year of the investigation. The anticipated findings include answers to research questions regarding preparation, developed skills, and important teaching practices that enable us to better understand how students move from capstone design courses into engineering workplaces. /  /

						<p>Thin films and membranes are ubiquitous in nature and technology, with examples including mylar films used in solar sails, biological membranes, thin metallic coatings, and flexible electronics. When such structures are subjected to complex stress states, such as shear, compression or non-equibiaxial loading, they can form wrinkles and permanent creases, which in turn affect their mechanical response. In order to design structures using this thin elements, it is important to understand their response to non trivial loading. /  / This project will combine experiments with numerical and theoretical analysis, in order to explore the behavior of thin films and membranes.
