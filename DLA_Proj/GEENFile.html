						<p>An increasing number of governments and aid organizations are choosing to relocate affected communities, transferring them to less geographically risky sites, after a major disaster hits. However, relocation often has harmful socioeconomic side effects and fails to separate people from the original, and new, hazards. Many civil engineering and construction decisions throughout relocation project implementation are influential in the overall risk experienced by community members.  / This research focuses on the relocation of over 16,000 families displaced when Tyhpoon Haiyan tore through Tacloban City, Philippines, in November 2013. Based on fieldwork conducted in Tacloban City for five months in 2016 and future fieldwork in late 2017, the Discovery Learning Apprentice will work closely with research team to build indicators for holistic risk reduction and use them to assess project outcomes at 12 relocation sites in Tacloban City. The student will learn and work closely with NVivo software and Qualitative Comparative Analysis.  /

						<p>This research project explores the future of textiles, the materials that make up clothes, drapery and upholstery. New methods for combining smart materials and conductive threads allow us to create textiles that can change color and shape in response to computational data. For instance, your shirt might change its pattern upon receiving and email or a stripe could travel between your shirt and the shirt of a nearby friend. A key challenge in developing new interactive behaviors for textiles is the lack of design software for creating and simulating different interactive behaviors. Thus, I am seeking a student who can help design software interfaces for programmable knitting and weaving machines that will allow people to design and simulate various computational behaviors on fabrics. This will involve learning both about traditional fabric production techniques like weaving and knitting; learning about various "smart" materials that can be integrated into fabric; and developing deeper knowledge of electronics and circuitry. This position will require both hands on construction of smart textiles as well as software work.  /  /

						<p>Concrete is the most utilized construction material in the world and the second-most consumed material on Earth after water. Consequently, its production, use, and disposal has global environmental consequences. For example, the manufacture of cement alone is responsible for 5-8% of global carbon dioxide emissions. In addition to neg, concrete sequesters non-trivial amounts of CO2 via carbonation – a chemical reaction between cement paste and CO2. This project will employ a previously validated model that predicts carbon sequestration potential of concrete and extend it to other concrete products, namely hemp-lime concrete (aka hempcrete), a novel insulation material for energy efficient buildings. The model will account for cement type and content, exposure, and time. The model will be used to investigate the effect of these factors and the influence of compressive strength and geometry, namely surface-area-to-volume (SA/V) ratio, on total carbon sequestration of hemp-lime concrete.

The atmospheric transmission window allows radiation at specific wavelength range (e.g. 8-14 µm) pass directly to the Universe without intermediate absorption and re-emission. This “free” cooling by infrared radiation to the Universe could enable an infinite-size low-temperature reservoir, which could help on addressing global energy and environmental challenges.  / We have developed a 1-KW sized Radiative Cooled-Cold Storage  (RadiCold) System, made of 8 modules. Each RadiCold module has 4’ × 4’ surface area. The objective of the project is to conduct multiple experimental tests to find out the performance of RadiCold modules and system under varying operating conditions (e.g. temperatures, clouds, condensation).  / Specific research tasks include: 1). Experimental testing of the RadiCold module and system performance; 2). Making suggestions on further improvements of the RadiCold module and system; 3). Investigating possible applications of the prototype RadiCold system; 4). Reporting progress on a weekly basis  /  /

						<p>This project uses computer simulations to optimize the location of groundwater monitoring wells to properly characterize the effectiveness of in situ remediation of contaminated groundwater.  During in situ groundwater remediation, a chemical or biological amendment is introduced into a contaminant plume to react with and degrade the contaminant.  The reactions occur at the contact area between the amendment and contaminant plumes.  We have developed a novel method that uses time-varying flow fields to increase the contact area and enhance degradation.  The effectiveness of the method has been demonstrated through computer simulations, which solve for concentrations of contaminant, amendment, and reaction product throughout the domain.  In a field setting, however, concentration data can only be collected at a finite number of wells, whose locations must be chosen strategically to maximize the amount of useful information available to evaluate the effectiveness of the method. The purpose of this project is to identify the set of optimal well locations that balances the tradeoff between maximizing the information obtained and minimizing cost.

						<p>Climate extremes (eg wildfire, flooding, and drought) can adversely impact the nation's drinking water sources. This research aims to develop a web-based application (e.g. R Shiny: https://shiny.rstudio.com/ or Bokeh: http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) to help utilities understand their risk of experiencing one of these events. To do so, an undergraduate researcher will perform a literature review on the impact of climate extremes on water quality, perform statistical analyses on the frequency and severity of various climate extremes, and create a national risk plot for wildfires, floods, and droughts. The project will culminate in a web-based computer app that can be shared with stakeholders to aid in their understanding of risks to their systems.  This application will be paired with results from simulation models of drinking water treatment performance to help utilities understand their resilience to these events and aid in long-term decision making.  The project couples a team of professors and one or more graduate students on an EPA-funded multi-year research project.  The main advisor will be a senior graduate student who is an expert in decision support for drinking water.

						<p>The purpose of this DLA project is to study the experiences and perceptions of individuals as they move from capstone courses into workplaces. It is increasingly important that we prepare our new engineering graduates to quickly and effectively contribute to the engineering workplace, and capstone design courses are central to this preparation. However, research highlights the differences between that which engineers do at work and the kinds of training they receive in school. Using a multi-case approach, this investigation seeks to understand how and to what extent capstone design courses prepare students to effectively enter communities of practice in engineering workplaces. The DLA student will meet weekly with faculty and be involved in collecting and analyzing data obtained through qualitative interviews and weekly reflective workplace surveys as well as selecting the cohort for the next year of the investigation. The anticipated findings include answers to research questions regarding preparation, developed skills, and important teaching practices that enable us to better understand how students move from capstone design courses into engineering workplaces. /  /

						<p>Silicon-germanium interfaces are one of the most widely studied interfaces due to their potential applications as thermoelectric materials in several energy conversion devices (e.g., multi-mission radioisotope generators in space missions). While several studies have addressed these systems, a clear understanding regarding the precise role of interfaces in nanostructured Si-Ge materials is not yet available. As interfaces control the functionalities of nanomaterials, to tailor the thermoelectric efficiency of Si-Ge applications, the role of various point defects at the interfaces, and how they influence the energy transport properties is crucial.
