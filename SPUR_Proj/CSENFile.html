						<p>Our experiments require images captioned with descriptions of the spatial arrangement of objects in the scene. While some datasets exist, they have a limited number of examples, and less variation in vocabulary than desirable. The undergraduate researcher would develop a web interface for labeling new examples for use by Amazon Mechanical Turkers (AMT). Additionally, they will learn about good data collection procedure and data verification techniques for AMT.

						<p>Wei-Te Chen, a CS Ph.D. student, will be working with Dr. Vilja Hulden (History) who is associated with Digital Humanities to make software for Natural Language Processing already on campus more accessible to Digital Humanities students. This requires revising and repackaging pre-existing NLP toolkits that are currently in use at the CLEAR lab by CS and LING Ph.D. students. We do not anticipate this to require extensive software development, though it will possibly require rewriting some portions of code; mainly, however, the task will be to streamline the usability by providing some scaffolding and detailed documentation.   /  / An undergraduate CS student could be very helpful in making minor code change, testing the changes, and providing feedback on alternative system presentations, all under the supervision of Wei-Te Chen, Martha Palmer and Jim Martin. /

						<p>Atomic Force Microscopes (AFMs) enable imaging down to the atomic scale (to a resolution of 1 Angstrom (10^{-10} meter)) and can image in liquids and also do not require imaging in vacuum. As a result, AFMs have become very popular imaging instruments in a number of fields. However, imaging speeds of commercial AFMs are very slow (minutes to acquire each image). This project investigates methods to improve AFM imaging speeds. A goal in this research community is to enable video rate AFM imaging speeds, so that the dynamics of e.g., biological phenomena can be studied. This overall project is a collaboration with researchers at Boston University. Our roles here at CU in this project include modeling, signal processing, and controls, including implementation and demonstration of developed methods on an experimental AFM testbed in our research laboratory.

						<p>Using the dataset described above, our system predicts the category of an unknown object given its description. One area of uncertainty is whether this task is doable without visual context. A human baseline would allow us to evaluate how the system compares to human performance. The undergraduate researcher would collect human judgments for the task, analyze the correlations between object categories and their descriptions, and correlations between the system predictions and human judgements.

						<p>VerbNet is an on-line verb dictionary that is currently being used by a DARPA project (CwC) and a DTRA project (eTASC). Feedback from users is prompting significant changes and updates to the existing organization and format of the resource.  It also provides mappings to other lexical resources, such as FrameNet, which are also being updated.   / Having someone go through and semi-automatically correct/update the mappings to other resources, and propagate systematic changes to the formatting and organization would be very helpful. This requires familiarity with XML and Python, and would be supervised by Kevin Stowe, a computational linguistics Ph.D. student in the Linguistics Department, and Dr. Susan Brown (Lecturer), and Professor Martha Palmer. /  /  /
