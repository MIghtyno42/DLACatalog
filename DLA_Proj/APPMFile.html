						<p>CRISPR-Cas9 is a relatively new genetic engineering technique used to make targeted changes to an organism's DNA. CRISPR-Cas9 is an enzyme that recognizes specific DNA sequences, or variations thereof, which it targets and cleaves from a host genome. It is generating new and exciting opportunities e.g. for the manipulation of microbial metabolisms. Unfortunately, however, this method is still error-prone and sub-optimal for gene editing. /  / The overarching goal of this project is to develop a physico-probabilistic model to predict the activity of CRISPR-Cas9 robustly. Our current model uses a published system of differential equations to model the rate at which CRISPR-Cas9 cleaves targets. Also, due to the complex inner workings of cells, it uses a Markov chain model to describe how CRISPR-Cas9 "zips" its guiding RNA with a target DNA sequence (so as to form an heteroduplex structure called R-loop). Our model depends on various unknown parameters, which need to be estimated from real data using optimation algorithms. Experimental data is being generated for this purpose by the Gill Lab at the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering here at CU-Boulder.

						<p>Perceptual learning is the technique of showing many training instances to a human learner, usually in visual manner, and forcing the learner to make a prediction/label while providing feedback. When done appropriately, this can develop a gut instinct in the learner, which appears to be how many human experts operate (i.e., a chess master can glance at a chess board and quickly form a first impression about the strength of a position; a forester can glance at a far-off tree and guess the species).  There is some software to automate this, called perceptual learning modules (PLM), but these PLM require the user to input a training set of labeled images which is clearly very time consuming. This project would create a PLM website that uses google image search to automatically generate the training set, so that the user specifies only the labels (such as “pine tree” and “spruce tree”) and the website generates corresponding training images. Students must be comfortable with web programming (accessing data via API’s, and building dynamic webpages).

						<p>Baroclinic instability is the primary process that generates large-scale variability in the atmosphere and oceans. Global ocean models in particular can have difficulty resolving this important process, and their success depends on the details of the model construction. In this project we will test how the various different approaches currently used in designing global ocean models impact the accuracy with which they represent baroclinic instability.  /  / The project begins by constructing linear systems of linear ordinary differential equations whose structure comes directly from the structure of existing global ocean models. These systems of differential equations are then analyzed using Fourier methods an eigenvalue computations to explore the fidelity of their representations of baroclinic instability. Finally, depending on results of the foregoing analysis, we may be able to suggest improvements in the construction of global ocean models with the goal of improving their representation of baroclinic instability.

						<p>This research project explores the future of textiles, the materials that make up clothes, drapery and upholstery. New methods for combining smart materials and conductive threads allow us to create textiles that can change color and shape in response to computational data. For instance, your shirt might change its pattern upon receiving and email or a stripe could travel between your shirt and the shirt of a nearby friend. A key challenge in developing new interactive behaviors for textiles is the lack of design software for creating and simulating different interactive behaviors. Thus, I am seeking a student who can help design software interfaces for programmable knitting and weaving machines that will allow people to design and simulate various computational behaviors on fabrics. This will involve learning both about traditional fabric production techniques like weaving and knitting; learning about various "smart" materials that can be integrated into fabric; and developing deeper knowledge of electronics and circuitry. This position will require both hands on construction of smart textiles as well as software work.  /  /

						<p>The Harvest Oil Platform is located about 10 km off the coast of central California near Vandenberg Air Force Base. The platform is anchored to the sea floor and sits in about 200 m of water near the western entrance to the Santa Barbara Channel. Conditions at Harvest are typical of the open ocean: wind waves and swell average about 2 m, though waves up to 10 m have been experienced during powerful winter storms. Harvest Platform serves as the prime calibration site for the NASA TOPEX/POSEIDON (1992–2005), Jason-1 (2001–2013), OSTM/Jason-2 (2008–) and Jason-3 (2016–) missions, and is an important international resource for the study of sea level from space. Harvest continues to serve a crucial role in validating data from precise spaceborne radar altimeter systems. The principal objectives of the proposed work are to preserve this vital long-term calibration record from Harvest, and to improve the skill with which the experiment can detect systematic errors in the altimeter measurement systems.  The DLA student will assist the calibration team at CU/CCAR and NASA JPL.

						<p>Living tissues are composed of cells that are complex systems using a combination of genetic and physical interactions during growth that result in morphogenesis (i.e. shape development). Understanding these mechanisms is critical in the design of bio-inspired programmable materials that reconfigure themselves in response to stimuli. Plant systems like algae are simple to study and provide great insights on the physical interactions leading to morphogenesis and help understand the process of growth. In this project, the student will closely work with a graduate student mentor to collect data from microscopic observations of the growth of a simple model: a green alga known as Coleochaete. The goal of this research will be to better understand how the mechanics of individual cell interactions govern macroscopic shape evolution of the alga. For this, experimental observations will be combined with computer simulations (performed by the graduate student) in order to identify the key parameters that control morphology changes and cell growth.  /

						<p>The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) is a constellation of satellites operated by the United States Air Force.  Three of the DMSP space environment instruments measure 1) local electric fields; 2) local magnetic fields; and 3) plasma particle flux in Low Earth Orbit. These data are available at two institutions: the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) and the NASA OMNIweb data base. We are interested in joining the data bases from the institutions to estimate energy deposition into the upper atmosphere along the satellite track.  Of particular interest is the relative location of energy being deposited by fields alone (Poynting flux) and by particles alone. Most energy seems to be coming into the auroral zones, however some recent investigations suggest that significant energy is coming into the polar cap.  This project will investigate how the energy deposition varies as the space atmosphere interaction region experiences different kinds of “forcing” due to disturbances propagating from the Sun.  /

						<p>The concept of engineering identity is a big one for engineering education researchers to  understand. Consider: Do you feel like you’re an engineer? Do you identify with the profession of engineering? Do others officially recognize you as an engineer? To what consequence?  / Beginning in the Fall 2017 semester, we are starting several exciting initiatives to better understand how the structure, environment and culture of our first-year courses impact how students are feeling about being engineers.  / In this DLA, you will work with e+ faculty to identify a research question you’d like to investigate related to concepts of identity development in the first-year of engineering undergraduate. Together we’ll design a research strategy, explore relevant background literature, then collect data related to the research question, analyze the data, and see what we can learn based on the analysis. Along the way you will gain experience designing and executing an educational research study in engineering, with potential to develop and facilitate surveys, convene focus groups and conduct interviews with enrolled engineering students.

						<p>Micro-grids for Smart Villages is a collaboration of UCB faculty, the Mortenson Center for Engineering in Developing Communities (MC-EDC), The IEEE Smart Village Program (ISV) and L’Institut Technique de la Côte-Sud (ITCS), Coteaux, Sud-Ouest, Haiti. The Haitian electrical power distribution grid was accessible to only about 10\% of the population before the earthquake of January 2010. Much of that infrastructure was destroyed. Practically, the Haitian grid of the future will have to grow from localized green energy farms be they photovoltaic, micro/pico hydro and/or wind. This development will require the training of a Haitian green energy work force as well as fundamentally new knowledge about design of power grids that are fundamentally variable in output. A micro-grid developed in Sud-Ouest, Haiti was devastated during Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. We have recently installed a micro-grid at are partners (ITCS) training site in southwest Haiti. We will continue monitoring as well as expanding this micro-grid. Students working with the program will assist in green energy research while interfacing with students, practitioners and researchers in Haiti. /

						<p>This project uses computer simulations to optimize the location of groundwater monitoring wells to properly characterize the effectiveness of in situ remediation of contaminated groundwater.  During in situ groundwater remediation, a chemical or biological amendment is introduced into a contaminant plume to react with and degrade the contaminant.  The reactions occur at the contact area between the amendment and contaminant plumes.  We have developed a novel method that uses time-varying flow fields to increase the contact area and enhance degradation.  The effectiveness of the method has been demonstrated through computer simulations, which solve for concentrations of contaminant, amendment, and reaction product throughout the domain.  In a field setting, however, concentration data can only be collected at a finite number of wells, whose locations must be chosen strategically to maximize the amount of useful information available to evaluate the effectiveness of the method. The purpose of this project is to identify the set of optimal well locations that balances the tradeoff between maximizing the information obtained and minimizing cost.

						<p>Climate extremes (eg wildfire, flooding, and drought) can adversely impact the nation's drinking water sources. This research aims to develop a web-based application (e.g. R Shiny: https://shiny.rstudio.com/ or Bokeh: http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) to help utilities understand their risk of experiencing one of these events. To do so, an undergraduate researcher will perform a literature review on the impact of climate extremes on water quality, perform statistical analyses on the frequency and severity of various climate extremes, and create a national risk plot for wildfires, floods, and droughts. The project will culminate in a web-based computer app that can be shared with stakeholders to aid in their understanding of risks to their systems.  This application will be paired with results from simulation models of drinking water treatment performance to help utilities understand their resilience to these events and aid in long-term decision making.  The project couples a team of professors and one or more graduate students on an EPA-funded multi-year research project.

						<p>The purpose of this DLA project is to study the experiences and perceptions of individuals as they move from capstone courses into workplaces. It is increasingly important that we prepare our new engineering graduates to quickly and effectively contribute to the engineering workplace, and capstone design courses are central to this preparation. However, research highlights the differences between that which engineers do at work and the kinds of training they receive in school. Using a multi-case approach, this investigation seeks to understand how and to what extent capstone design courses prepare students to effectively enter communities of practice in engineering workplaces. The DLA student will meet weekly with faculty and be involved in collecting and analyzing data obtained through qualitative interviews and weekly reflective workplace surveys as well as selecting the cohort for the next year of the investigation. The anticipated findings include answers to research questions regarding preparation, developed skills, and important teaching practices that enable us to better understand how students move from capstone design courses into engineering workplaces. /  /

						<p>The aim of this project is to investigate steady, shallow, standing wave structures when supercritical water flows around an obstacle, the whole system subject to the coriolis force due to rotation.  This project primarily involves the mathematical modeling and analysis of the free surface in the weakly nonlinear, long wave, slow rotation regime.  The simplest model of effectively one-dimensional, dynamic wave propagation in this regime is the rotating Korteweg-de Vries (rKdV) equation, also known as the Ostrovsky equation.  In this project, the student will develop and analyze the two-dimensional, steady counterpart to this problem where, due to the supercritical flow speed, one spatial dimension acts in a time-like fashion.  Using multiscale asymptotic methods, the student will derive the steady rKdV equation and identify its regime of validity (restrictions on water depth, wave height, and rotation speed).  The resulting equation will be analyzed and numerical simulations will be performed for steady flows with obstacles.  The insight gleaned from this project may lead to the construction of a rotating table experimental apparatus for this system.

						<p>Antiferromagnets are materials where each molecule's spin is ordered so that neighboring spins point in opposite directions. Recently, antiferromagnets have been considered attractive materials for spintronics applications, i.e., those that use spin current rather than or in addition to charge current in circuitry. The Dispersive Hydrodynamics Laboratory (DHL) is investigating spin dynamics in magnetic materials utilizing a novel hydrodynamic formulation that DHL members recently derived for a class of ferromagnets.  This theory interprets spin dynamics in a solid state magnet as fluid dynamics for which spin-density waves and nonlinear structures such as magnetic vortices can be better understood. The student who pursues this project will extend the hydrodynamic partial differential equations to antiferromagnetic materials, building upon work by DHL group members. Special solutions known as uniform hydrodynamic states and spin-density waves will be derived. Their dynamic stability and associated dispersion relation shall be assessed.  Finally, the student will search for other nonlinear structures, such as solitons, dispersive shock waves, and vortices.

As interfaces control the functionalities of nanomaterials, to tailor the thermoelectric efficiency of Si-Ge applications, the role of various point defects at the interfaces, and how they influence the energy transport properties is crucial.

						<p>When shallow water flows sufficiently slowly or rapidly over a one-dimensional, broad, submerged obstacle, the water surface develops a smooth, stationary profile.  Within a moderate flow regime, known as the transcritical regime, the flow profile becomes unsteady, yielding the generation of propagating nonlinear waves.  In this project, the student will investigate the two-dimensional, standing wave analogy to this phenomenon in which spatial variation in one direction behaves similar to the temporal variation in the aforementioned dynamic problem.  Both experiments and mathematics will be developed to study this problem.  Of particular interest is the role of surface tension at fluid depths of about 5mm where the water wave dispersion curvature changes sign.  It has recently been shown that hydrodynamic flows with non-convex dispersion can yield new, non-classical, nonlinear wave structures.  The aim of this project is to generate and mathematically model non-classical dispersive shock waves and solitons.  The student will develop skills in partial differential equations, numerical methods, asymptotic analysis, and fluid dynamics.

						<p>The Android framework is complex, making it extremely difficult to difficult to develop apps that work as intended.  For example, it is quite easy to write an app that unexpected crashes your phone by misusing the framework.  The goal of this project is to develop tools and algorithms that find and fix defects in Android apps.

						<p>The engagement of the Mickelson group in applications of rural telecommunications (Nepal, Peru, Cameroon, Papua New Guinea (PNG)) is longstanding (a decade). The group has worked cooperatively with various Universities, NGOs, health entities, government entities and funding agencies (Venture, IEEE - Foundation, Humanitarian Activities Committee (HAC) and Smart Village (SV)) on health, education and commerce projects. The group is presently constructing a Wi-Fi Long Distance Testbed here in Boulder in order to pre-test wireless equipment before jungle/mountain installations far from home. New equipment for this highly innovative technology is constantly appearing as is simulation software. The group has also been testing innovative power supply solutions for the mainly solar powered Industry, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band installations. There is an option for students working with us here to who have interest in rural telecommunications to join us during assessment, installation and evaluation trips to distant locations.  /
