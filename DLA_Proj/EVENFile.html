					<p>Sustainable sanitation systems require the functional integration of infrastructure and society; however, most studies focus on technology innovation and do not adequately account for how human behavior and social needs affect, and are affected by, sanitation systems. In resource-limited communities, sanitation systems continue to experience high failure rates. To address this gap, this research aims to elucidate the community processes (community priorities, stakeholder engagement processes, and training processes) and infrastructure designs that result in sustainable sanitation systems. Data collected from 20 communities in India will be used in the analysis. We will analyze how combined community processes and infrastructure designs affect the sustainability of sanitation and integrated sanitation and resource recovery systems using Qualitative Comparative Analysis. We will develop metrics to  evaluate the social, behavioral, and environmental impacts of sanitation and resource recovery systems in a life cycle analysis. Responsibilities will include coding and analyzing qualitative interview data, literature review, and assisting with conference and journal article authorship. /

					<h4 align = "left">Description</h4>
					<p>For the decade, oil and gas development in the United States has relied on horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to extract oil and gas from shale and tight sands.  Hydraulic fracturing fluids include chemicals of concern for groundwater contamination.  Recently, some oil and gas operators have claimed to make fracturing fluids "greener" -- to replace some potentially toxic compounds with less toxic compounds.  The claims of greener fracturing fluids have not been confirmed. /  / For this study, we intend to examine trends in the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluid from 2011 to the present using publicly-available data (the "FracFocus" database).  Using the 120,000 records of hydraulic fracturing jobs across the United States, we will review use for geographical (by state, by oil and gas basin), hydrocarbon type (oil, wet gas, dry gas), and temporal trends.  The temporal trends will be adjusted for geographic and hydrocarbon differences and assessed for changes in the frequency and amount of use of chemicals of concern.

					<p>An increasing number of governments and aid organizations are choosing to relocate affected communities, transferring them to less geographically risky sites, after a major disaster hits. However, relocation often has harmful socioeconomic side effects and fails to separate people from the original, and new, hazards. Many civil engineering and construction decisions throughout relocation project implementation are influential in the overall risk experienced by community members.  / This research focuses on the relocation of over 16,000 families displaced when Tyhpoon Haiyan tore through Tacloban City, Philippines, in November 2013. Based on fieldwork conducted in Tacloban City for five months in 2016 and future fieldwork in late 2017, the Discovery Learning Apprentice will work closely with research team to build indicators for holistic risk reduction and use them to assess project outcomes at 12 relocation sites in Tacloban City.

					<h4 align = "left">Description</h4>
					<p>This project uses computer simulations to optimize the location of groundwater monitoring wells to properly characterize the effectiveness of in situ remediation of contaminated groundwater.  During in situ groundwater remediation, a chemical or biological amendment is introduced into a contaminant plume to react with and degrade the contaminant.  The reactions occur at the contact area between the amendment and contaminant plumes.  We have developed a novel method that uses time-varying flow fields to increase the contact area and enhance degradation.  The effectiveness of the method has been demonstrated through computer simulations, which solve for concentrations of contaminant, amendment, and reaction product throughout the domain.  In a field setting, however, concentration data can only be collected at a finite number of wells, whose locations must be chosen strategically to maximize the amount of useful information available to evaluate the effectiveness of the method. The purpose of this project is to identify the set of optimal well locations that balances the tradeoff between maximizing the information obtained and minimizing cost.

					<h4 align = "left">Description</h4>
					<p>This research project explores the future of textiles, the materials that make up clothes, drapery and upholstery. New methods for combining smart materials and conductive threads allow us to create textiles that can change color and shape in response to computational data. For instance, your shirt might change its pattern upon receiving and email or a stripe could travel between your shirt and the shirt of a nearby friend. A key challenge in developing new interactive behaviors for textiles is the lack of design software for creating and simulating different interactive behaviors. Thus, I am seeking a student who can help design software interfaces for programmable knitting and weaving machines that will allow people to design and simulate various computational behaviors on fabrics. This will involve learning both about traditional fabric production techniques like weaving and knitting; learning about various "smart" materials that can be integrated into fabric; and developing deeper knowledge of electronics and circuitry. This position will require both hands on construction of smart textiles as well as software work.  /  /

					<p>The concept of engineering identity is a big one for engineering education researchers to  understand. Consider: Do you feel like you’re an engineer? Do you identify with the profession of engineering? Do others officially recognize you as an engineer? To what consequence?  / Beginning in the Fall 2017 semester, we are starting several exciting initiatives to better understand how the structure, environment and culture of our first-year courses impact how students are feeling about being engineers.  / In this DLA, you will work with e+ faculty to identify a research question you’d like to investigate related to concepts of identity development in the first-year of engineering undergraduate. Together we’ll design a research strategy, explore relevant background literature, then collect data related to the research question, analyze the data, and see what we can learn based on the analysis. Along the way you will gain experience designing and executing an educational research study in engineering, with potential to develop and facilitate surveys, convene focus groups and conduct interviews with enrolled engineering students.

					<p>With an aging population research regarding cognitive, developmental and physical disabilities is becoming increasingly important.  People with disabilities is a very underserved population and many of the clients have client specific needs that can not be met with available or affordable technology or devices. While my students do research and design for a specific client there are usually others out there who can use a similar low-cost device.   /  / I want to follow up with the clients and understand details of their use of the research and how it impacts their lives.  The student would help to write up the research in journals so that other people with special needs have access to the research we have done.  The student will help to investigate technological research literature in this area or scientific community based learning literature.  I believe there is much to publish about the pedagogy of community based research.  I am currently beginning work with CU Engage which is CU-Boulder’s Center for Community Based Learning and Research.  This center will provide help with the publications.

					<p>The purpose of this DLA project is to study the experiences and perceptions of individuals as they move from capstone courses into workplaces. It is increasingly important that we prepare our new engineering graduates to quickly and effectively contribute to the engineering workplace, and capstone design courses are central to this preparation. However, research highlights the differences between that which engineers do at work and the kinds of training they receive in school. Using a multi-case approach, this investigation seeks to understand how and to what extent capstone design courses prepare students to effectively enter communities of practice in engineering workplaces. The DLA student will meet weekly with faculty and be involved in collecting and analyzing data obtained through qualitative interviews and weekly reflective workplace surveys as well as selecting the cohort for the next year of the investigation. The anticipated findings include answers to research questions regarding preparation, developed skills, and important teaching practices that enable us to better understand how students move from capstone design courses into engineering workplaces. /  /
