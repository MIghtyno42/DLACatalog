					<p>Coastal Ecuador experienced a magnitude 7.8 earthquake on April 16, 2016, destroying thousands of homes. In the aftermath of the earthquake, national and local governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are assisting communities repair and rebuild homes. As a part of this project, we are trying to understand how community members participate in housing reconstruction, how reconstructed houses will perform in a future hazard event, and how participation and performance impact community resilience. In the coming year, we will be examining participation and performance specifically. The graduate research assistant (GRA) will be performing observations, conducting interviews, collecting documents, and taking measurements to accrue data on community participation in the planning, design, and construction of post-disaster housing as well as the design and construction quality. The DLA can expect to assist in the analysis of this data with such tasks as qualitative coding of interview transcripts, calibration of data for qualitative comparative analysis, and the creation of structural models for the various housing typologies. /

					<p>Micro-grids for Smart Villages is a collaboration of UCB faculty, the Mortenson Center for Engineering in Developing Communities (MC-EDC), The IEEE Smart Village Program (ISV) and L’Institut Technique de la Côte-Sud (ITCS), Coteaux, Sud-Ouest, Haiti. The Haitian electrical power distribution grid was accessible to only about 10\% of the population before the earthquake of January 2010. Much of that infrastructure was destroyed. Practically, the Haitian grid of the future will have to grow from localized green energy farms be they photovoltaic, micro/pico hydro and/or wind. This development will require the training of a Haitian green energy work force as well as fundamentally new knowledge about design of power grids that are fundamentally variable in output. A micro-grid developed in Sud-Ouest, Haiti was devastated during Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. We have recently installed a micro-grid at are partners (ITCS) training site in southwest Haiti. We will continue monitoring as well as expanding this micro-grid. Students working with the program will assist in green energy research while interfacing with students, practitioners and researchers in Haiti. /

					<p>The engagement of the Mickelson group in applications of rural telecommunications (Nepal, Peru, Cameroon, Papua New Guinea (PNG)) is longstanding (a decade). The group has worked cooperatively with various Universities, NGOs, health entities, government entities and funding agencies (Venture, IEEE - Foundation, Humanitarian Activities Committee (HAC) and Smart Village (SV)) on health, education and commerce projects. The group is presently constructing a Wi-Fi Long Distance Testbed here in Boulder in order to pre-test wireless equipment before jungle/mountain installations far from home. New equipment for this highly innovative technology is constantly appearing as is simulation software. The group has also been testing innovative power supply solutions for the mainly solar powered Industry, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band installations. There is an option for students working with us here to who have interest in rural telecommunications to join us during assessment, installation and evaluation trips to distant locations.  /

					<p>Sustainable sanitation systems require the functional integration of infrastructure and society; however, most studies focus on technology innovation and do not adequately account for how human behavior and social needs affect, and are affected by, sanitation systems. In resource-limited communities, sanitation systems continue to experience high failure rates. To address this gap, this research aims to elucidate the community processes (community priorities, stakeholder engagement processes, and training processes) and infrastructure designs that result in sustainable sanitation systems. Data collected from 20 communities in India will be used in the analysis. We will analyze how combined community processes and infrastructure designs affect the sustainability of sanitation and integrated sanitation and resource recovery systems using Qualitative Comparative Analysis. We will develop metrics to  evaluate the social, behavioral, and environmental impacts of sanitation and resource recovery systems in a life cycle analysis. Responsibilities will include coding and analyzing qualitative interview data, literature review, and assisting with conference and journal article authorship. /

					<p>An increasing number of governments and aid organizations are choosing to relocate affected communities, transferring them to less geographically risky sites, after a major disaster hits. However, relocation often has harmful socioeconomic side effects and fails to separate people from the original, and new, hazards. Many civil engineering and construction decisions throughout relocation project implementation are influential in the overall risk experienced by community members.  / This research focuses on the relocation of over 16,000 families displaced when Tyhpoon Haiyan tore through Tacloban City, Philippines, in November 2013. Based on fieldwork conducted in Tacloban City for five months in 2016 and future fieldwork in late 2017, the Discovery Learning Apprentice will work closely with research team to build indicators for holistic risk reduction and use them to assess project outcomes at 12 relocation sites in Tacloban City. The student will learn and work closely with NVivo software and Qualitative Comparative Analysis.  /
