					<p>In urban environments, infrastructure components are not isolated. Due to their close proximity, they interact with one another during earthquakes by affecting the static and dynamic stresses in the underlying interface soil. The research objective is to identify the key predictors of the performance of a building cluster on softened ground by: (1) performing centrifuge experiments to fundamentally evaluate multiple structure-soil-structure interaction on liquefiable ground and the impact and relative importance of the properties of building, ground motion, mitigation strategy, and cluster on the EDPs of structure and surrounding soil; (2) developing validated nonlinear numerical models of the coupled structure-soil-structure systems that are studied experimentally; and (3) performing a preliminary parametric study with the calibrated numerical models to define the most efficient ground motion predicting parameters of the performance of building clusters on softened ground. The undergraduate student involved in this project will be heavily involved in centrifuge modeling and data processing/visualization component of this research.

					<p>Coastal Ecuador experienced a magnitude 7.8 earthquake on April 16, 2016, destroying thousands of homes. In the aftermath of the earthquake, national and local governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are assisting communities repair and rebuild homes. As a part of this project, we are trying to understand how community members participate in housing reconstruction, how reconstructed houses will perform in a future hazard event, and how participation and performance impact community resilience. In the coming year, we will be examining participation and performance specifically. The graduate research assistant (GRA) will be performing observations, conducting interviews, collecting documents, and taking measurements to accrue data on community participation in the planning, design, and construction of post-disaster housing as well as the design and construction quality. The DLA can expect to assist in the analysis of this data with such tasks as qualitative coding of interview transcripts, calibration of data for qualitative comparative analysis, and the creation of structural models for the various housing typologies. /

					<p>Micro-grids for Smart Villages is a collaboration of UCB faculty, the Mortenson Center for Engineering in Developing Communities (MC-EDC), The IEEE Smart Village Program (ISV) and L’Institut Technique de la Côte-Sud (ITCS), Coteaux, Sud-Ouest, Haiti. The Haitian electrical power distribution grid was accessible to only about 10\% of the population before the earthquake of January 2010. Much of that infrastructure was destroyed. Practically, the Haitian grid of the future will have to grow from localized green energy farms be they photovoltaic, micro/pico hydro and/or wind. This development will require the training of a Haitian green energy work force as well as fundamentally new knowledge about design of power grids that are fundamentally variable in output. A micro-grid developed in Sud-Ouest, Haiti was devastated during Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. We have recently installed a micro-grid at are partners (ITCS) training site in southwest Haiti. We will continue monitoring as well as expanding this micro-grid. Students working with the program will assist in green energy research while interfacing with students, practitioners and researchers in Haiti. /

					<p>Sustainable sanitation systems require the functional integration of infrastructure and society; however, most studies focus on technology innovation and do not adequately account for how human behavior and social needs affect, and are affected by, sanitation systems. In resource-limited communities, sanitation systems continue to experience high failure rates. To address this gap, this research aims to elucidate the community processes (community priorities, stakeholder engagement processes, and training processes) and infrastructure designs that result in sustainable sanitation systems. Data collected from 20 communities in India will be used in the analysis. We will analyze how combined community processes and infrastructure designs affect the sustainability of sanitation and integrated sanitation and resource recovery systems using Qualitative Comparative Analysis. We will develop metrics to  evaluate the social, behavioral, and environmental impacts of sanitation and resource recovery systems in a life cycle analysis. Responsibilities will include coding and analyzing qualitative interview data, literature review, and assisting with conference and journal article authorship. /

					<p>An increasing number of governments and aid organizations are choosing to relocate affected communities, transferring them to less geographically risky sites, after a major disaster hits. However, relocation often has harmful socioeconomic side effects and fails to separate people from the original, and new, hazards. Many civil engineering and construction decisions throughout relocation project implementation are influential in the overall risk experienced by community members.  / This research focuses on the relocation of over 16,000 families displaced when Tyhpoon Haiyan tore through Tacloban City, Philippines, in November 2013. Based on fieldwork conducted in Tacloban City for five months in 2016 and future fieldwork in late 2017, the Discovery Learning Apprentice will work closely with research team to build indicators for holistic risk reduction and use them to assess project outcomes at 12 relocation sites in Tacloban City.

					<h4 align = "left">Description</h4>
					<p>This project uses computer simulations to optimize the location of groundwater monitoring wells to properly characterize the effectiveness of in situ remediation of contaminated groundwater.  During in situ groundwater remediation, a chemical or biological amendment is introduced into a contaminant plume to react with and degrade the contaminant.  The reactions occur at the contact area between the amendment and contaminant plumes.  We have developed a novel method that uses time-varying flow fields to increase the contact area and enhance degradation.  The effectiveness of the method has been demonstrated through computer simulations, which solve for concentrations of contaminant, amendment, and reaction product throughout the domain.  In a field setting, however, concentration data can only be collected at a finite number of wells, whose locations must be chosen strategically to maximize the amount of useful information available to evaluate the effectiveness of the method. The purpose of this project is to identify the set of optimal well locations that balances the tradeoff between maximizing the information obtained and minimizing cost.

					<p>This research project explores the future of textiles, the materials that make up clothes, drapery and upholstery. New methods for combining smart materials and conductive threads allow us to create textiles that can change color and shape in response to computational data. For instance, your shirt might change its pattern upon receiving and email or a stripe could travel between your shirt and the shirt of a nearby friend. A key challenge in developing new interactive behaviors for textiles is the lack of design software for creating and simulating different interactive behaviors. Thus, I am seeking a student who can help design software interfaces for programmable knitting and weaving machines that will allow people to design and simulate various computational behaviors on fabrics. This will involve learning both about traditional fabric production techniques like weaving and knitting; learning about various "smart" materials that can be integrated into fabric; and developing deeper knowledge of electronics and circuitry. This position will require both hands on construction of smart textiles as well as software work.  /  /

					<p>Concrete is the most utilized construction material in the world and the second-most consumed material on Earth after water. Consequently, its production, use, and disposal has global environmental consequences. For example, the manufacture of cement alone is responsible for 5-8% of global carbon dioxide emissions. In addition to neg, concrete sequesters non-trivial amounts of CO2 via carbonation – a chemical reaction between cement paste and CO2. This project will employ a previously validated model that predicts carbon sequestration potential of concrete and extend it to other concrete products, namely hemp-lime concrete (aka hempcrete), a novel insulation material for energy efficient buildings. The model will account for cement type and content, exposure, and time. The model will be used to investigate the effect of these factors and the influence of compressive strength and geometry, namely surface-area-to-volume (SA/V) ratio, on total carbon sequestration of hemp-lime concrete.

					<p>Population growth, overuse of current source waters, and with extended droughts have necessitated the use of alternative sources for drinking water. Reverse osmosis membranes can be used on the coasts, but inland brine  disposal issues have forced the exploration of other technologies. One sustainable technology is the use of biofiltration coupled with ozone disinfection and in some cases adsorption with activated carbon. Biofiltartion is achieved my allowing biomass to accumulated on the surface of media (sand, anthracite, etc) in a filter / column.  / In this study we will evaluated the use of biofiltration with a wide range of filter media, including biochar, and consider a range of alternative source waters including stormwater, greywater, and treated wastewater effluent. The study will require the DLA to work with a graduate student in the lab assisting in the completion of the study.

					<p>The purpose of this DLA project is to study the experiences and perceptions of individuals as they move from capstone courses into workplaces. It is increasingly important that we prepare our new engineering graduates to quickly and effectively contribute to the engineering workplace, and capstone design courses are central to this preparation. However, research highlights the differences between that which engineers do at work and the kinds of training they receive in school. Using a multi-case approach, this investigation seeks to understand how and to what extent capstone design courses prepare students to effectively enter communities of practice in engineering workplaces. The DLA student will meet weekly with faculty and be involved in collecting and analyzing data obtained through qualitative interviews and weekly reflective workplace surveys as well as selecting the cohort for the next year of the investigation. The anticipated findings include answers to research questions regarding preparation, developed skills, and important teaching practices that enable us to better understand how students move from capstone design courses into engineering workplaces. /  /

					<p>Thin films and membranes are ubiquitous in nature and technology, with examples including mylar films used in solar sails, biological membranes, thin metallic coatings, and flexible electronics. When such structures are subjected to complex stress states, such as shear, compression or non-equibiaxial loading, they can form wrinkles and permanent creases, which in turn affect their mechanical response. In order to design structures using this thin elements, it is important to understand their response to non trivial loading. /  / This project will combine experiments with numerical and theoretical analysis, in order to explore the behavior of thin films and membranes. One of the main goals is the design and assembly of an experimental apparatus able to apply different biaxial loadings to thin membranes, in order to excite different states of stress in the material. The set-up will test different specimens, such as commercial films (mylar) and elastomeric membranes built by the student. /  / The work will be done in close collaboration with an incoming PhD student.

					<p>Several designs for deployable space structures require materials that are able to be folded to very high curvatures, in order to fit in the launch vehicle, yet still remain a high stiffness once deployed. An interesting option are high strain composites, which are fiber composites in which the material and layout selection are designed to increase the curvature at which they fail when bent. However, the failure properties of this family of materials is still not understood, which prevents their use in practical designs. /  / The goal of this project is to study the failure of this type of flexible composites under different loading conditions, with emphasis on bending. The student will adapt existing testing equipment to the specific needs of this specimens (very low axial loading, large rotations), and develop a protocol to test them until failure. The samples will then analyzed, in order to identify the failure mechanisms taking place. This observation will be used to create physics-based models that can be incorporated in the design cycle of deployable structures. /  / The work will be performed in collaboration with an incoming PhD student.
