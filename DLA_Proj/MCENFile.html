					<p>In urban environments, infrastructure components are not isolated. Due to their close proximity, they interact with one another during earthquakes by affecting the static and dynamic stresses in the underlying interface soil. The research objective is to identify the key predictors of the performance of a building cluster on softened ground by: (1) performing centrifuge experiments to fundamentally evaluate multiple structure-soil-structure interaction on liquefiable ground and the impact and relative importance of the properties of building, ground motion, mitigation strategy, and cluster on the EDPs of structure and surrounding soil; (2) developing validated nonlinear numerical models of the coupled structure-soil-structure systems that are studied experimentally; and (3) performing a preliminary parametric study with the calibrated numerical models to define the most efficient ground motion predicting parameters of the performance of building clusters on softened ground. The undergraduate student involved in this project will be heavily involved in centrifuge modeling and data processing/visualization component of this research.

					<p>The goal of the ninja car project is to demonstrate on-board perception, planning and control algorithms for driving ground vehicles capable of dynamic “gymnastic moves” such as jumping, drifting, rolling, bouncing, tumbling or wall-driving. This capability for fast, lightweight autonomous ground vehicles is possible due to the confluence of innovative algorithms for perception, planning and control, as well as new actuators and small form factor computing. Our platform of choice is a small 1/8th scale off-road racing vehicle, modified with sensing, jump-actuation and on-board computing. Our goal is to reliably automate the execution of these dynamic, “gymnastic” maneuvers. We envision ninja cars launching off inclined surfaces, bouncing down walls, jumping through open windows, much like human parkour runners fly through urban spaces today. The question arises: where can such a novel class of vehicle actually drive?  How much of the world is accessible to this class of vehicle? These platforms will be useful in a variety of contexts including cluttered terrain navigation, long-term surveillance, and high-speed pursuit using a variety of novel control maneuvers, such as jumping.

					<p>Space habitat environmental control uses multi-layer insulation and thermal shields to passively protect the habitat from both hot and cold external environments, then Active Thermal Control Systems keep the cabin temperature within the desired range. Typically, water cooling loops pick up heat from cold plates attached to the electronic equipment and experiments. The heated water then flows through interface heat exchangers to external coolant loops that then transport the heat to radiators, which in turn reject the heat to space. / Ground-based development of cooling loops, heat exchangers and radiators requires thermal vacuum chambers (TVACs) to simulate the space environment during experiments. An AES Bioastronautics Laboratory TVAC was designed to test integrated systems, but still needs work to complete the development and installation of the liquid nitrogen (LN2) cooling shroud. / A student on this project will rework and test a cylindrical LN2 shroud. Then, the student will design, build and test flat-plate LN2 shrouds for the chamber endcap and door. Once completed, the student will conduct tests to characterize the chamber environment with cooling provided by the LN2 shrouds.

					<h4 align = "left">Description</h4>
					<p>When astronauts return to Earth from extended exposure to microgravity they experience substantial sensorimotor/neurovestibular deconditioning. This results in loss of balance, poor locomotion, degraded motor control, and errors in orientation perception. Specifically, when returning astronauts tilt their heads they often become very disoriented and perceive they are translating. To further investigate this phenomenon, we are developing a ground-based analog. We restrain subject’s head movements using a motorized wheelchair device to reproduce some of the similar motion patterns experienced in space. Experiments last up to 12 hours. Afterwards we measure balance, locomotion, and orientation perception using a battery of tests. We are working on then testing their perception of orientation and motion using a human-rated motion device that can tilt and translate. Responsibilities will include developing hardware and software for our wheelchair device and motion devices, testing them for safety, performing human subject experiments, and analyzing data.   /  /

					<p>In space exploration missions, when exposure to microgravity astronauts experience physiological deconditioning (e.g. bone and muscle loss, cardiovascular deconditioning, sensorimotor impairment, visual changes, etc.). An ideal countermeasure to recreate the loading using artificial gravity through centrifugation. A desired gravitational load can be created by a very large, slowly rotating centrifuge or far more practically a short radius centrifuge rotating a high speeds. However, faster rotation rates cause disorientation due to the vestibular cross-coupled illusion. We are studying how fast of rotation rates are tolerable to inform how large a centrifuge design must be. This is done by performing human subject experiments using our "Human Rotator Device". Responsibilities will include developing hardware and software for our motion devices, testing them for safety, performing human subject experiments, and analyzing data.

					<p>Shape-Memory Polymers (SMPs) have unique properties that allow them to alter their shape in response to specific stimuli. By bonding a pre-strained, thermally-responsive Shape Memory Polymer film to an elastomeric substrate of similar thickness, applying localized heat between the layers causes contraction of the SMP layer, and a bending motion of the entire bi-layer system. This project aims to study the relationship between the programming conditions of the SMP, substrate thickness, and bending curvature. Experimental results are compared to a theoretical, finite element model. This knowledge is then used to realize deployable structures through origami self-folding.

					<p>Most conventional medical stents were made from metal to keep vessel or urethra open, however, neointimal hyperplasia and smooth muscle cells accumulation are reported for bare metal stents, which leads to inflammation and turbulent blood flow. Another issue occurs when implanting the stent into the vessel. Doctors need to insert a balloon catheter into patient’s vessel during surgery, which may cause pain, damage to the tissue and even inflammation to the healthy part. Shape memory polymers (SMP), apart from the bio-inert property, offers more potentials to realize a smart and flexible bio-medical stent. In this research, we used SMP as the structure material for the stent and integrated sensors that at the same time detect the bio-condition. Currently we are working on mixing Nano-Ferro-Magnetic particles with our SMPs to achieve remotely controlling the moving of the stent and the place it fixed. Considering that we could always adjust the transition temperature by change the chemical ratio in our formula, it will be more promising to trigger the transition at a little higher than body temperature, and alternating magnetic field could adopt to heat up the stent.
