						<p>Atomic Force Microscopes (AFMs) enable imaging down to the atomic scale (to a resolution of 1 Angstrom (10^{-10} meter)) and can image in liquids and also do not require imaging in vacuum. As a result, AFMs have become very popular imaging instruments in a number of fields. However, imaging speeds of commercial AFMs are very slow (minutes to acquire each image). This project investigates methods to improve AFM imaging speeds. A goal in this research community is to enable video rate AFM imaging speeds, so that the dynamics of e.g., biological phenomena can be studied. This overall project is a collaboration with researchers at Boston University. Our roles here at CU in this project include modeling, signal processing, and controls, including implementation and demonstration of developed methods on an experimental AFM testbed in our research laboratory.
