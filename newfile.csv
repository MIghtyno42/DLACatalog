AlN is highly thermally conductive, is an electrical insulator and is unaffected structurally by UV light.   The benefit of the project is to improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of UV-LED lighting through effective heat removal and minimized AlN use (part design).  The PI's lab is expert in ALD and non-oxide ceramic materials and developed this concept in response to a recognized need for UV-LED heat removal.  3D printing will Increase design freedom & provide the ability to design more functional parts (perform better with lattice structures not possible to incorporate by conventional processing).

This activity has been attributed to a cobalt morphology novel to both ALD and FTS; namely that cobalt is depositing epitaxially on the crystalline regions of the Al2O3 surface and creating cobalt monolayers. We believe that altering the Al2O3 support will allow us to control the cobalt deposition process during ALD and ultimately increase the activity of these catalysts for FTS. Undergraduate work will consist primarily of assisting in the catalyst synthesis process via Al2O3 modification, ALD system building/use, and testing these catalysts in the FTS reactors.

During in situ groundwater remediation, a chemical or biological amendment is introduced into a contaminant plume to react with and degrade the contaminant.  The reactions occur at the contact area between the amendment and contaminant plumes.  We have developed a novel method that uses time-varying flow fields to increase the contact area and enhance degradation.  The effectiveness of the method has been demonstrated through computer simulations, which solve for concentrations of contaminant, amendment, and reaction product throughout the domain.  In a field setting, however, concentration data can only be collected at a finite number of wells, whose locations must be chosen strategically to maximize the amount of useful information available to evaluate the effectiveness of the method. The purpose of this project is to identify the set of optimal well locations that balances the tradeoff between maximizing the information obtained and minimizing cost.

There are several FDA approved protein therapeutics available, however, the delicate nature of proteins means that even small mechanical shocks to the vial (e.g., dropping a vial onto ground, shipping and handling of vials) can cause bubbles to nucleate, grow, then collapse, which is known as cavitation.  Cavitation has been shown to (1) denature the protein thereby lessening its therapeutic effectiveness, and (2) cause the protein to aggregate which can elicit an immune response from the patient.  To mitigate these effects, we are working to create surfaces which can resist protein adsorption and simultaneously increase the mechanical energy threshold before cavitation occurs.  There are two main approaches that we will employ: (1) patterning of the surfaces using sol-gel chemistry, and (2) functionalization of surfaces using silane and amine chemistries.

Many toys and kits have emerged for children to code or to create and express themselves with technology. However, these toys and kits often focus on children 8 years old and up. Toys that are available for young children to learn to code are often expensive or narrow in what can be done with them. In this project, we'll play-test existing toys to examine the space of what exists and imagine what's possible by developing new prototypes.

Products like Timehop, Facebook’s “On This Day” and “Lookback”, and Google Photo’s “Remember This Day” present us with photos, status updates, and events from our pasts with the opportunity to revisit past experiences. But these algorithms also remind you of bad breakups, serious injuries, and the deaths of loved ones. At best, negative memories are the annoying byproduct of ignorant algorithms. At worst, they are traumatic.  /  / Students in this project will explore how we can design more compassionate algorithms using a combination of computational social science, systems building, and user studies. Ideal students will have taken courses in dev ops, algorithms, HCI, or HCC, and have an interest in big data and the design of social technologies.",,,,,,,,Computer Science,,,,,,,,Moderate Supervision

This work focuses on fabricating mechanically stiff constructs for cartilage tissue engineering and regeneration. Due to the relatively large physiological loads imparted on cartilage tissue, the mechanical properties of the constructs must be well understood, predictable, and applied in our 3D printing software design. The student working on this project will concentrate on the optimization and validation of novel material characterization models under the supervision of a materials science graduate student, for the development of 3D printing software that incorporates this model. The undergraduate on this project will gain experience with LabVIEW and Matlab by writing a software that predicts the parameters necessary for desired 3D printed construct properties. Additionally, the undergraduate will test the software by learning to fabricate complex constructs and learning to use mec",,,,,Chemical Engineering,,,,Electrical Engineering,Electrical & Computer Engineering,Engineering Physics,,,,,Moderate Supervision

Hate that there are few development tools for it?  Dynamic languages like JavaScript are extremely flexible leading to a proliferation of very powerful frameworks.  At the same, this flexibility is what makes tools for these languages so difficult to build and so poor in general.  The goal of this project is to codify the idioms that framework developers use in the form of types or other kinds of specifications and design tools and checkers that support these idiomatic uses of dynamic languages.","Looking for an enthusiastic, self-motivated student with strong programming skills.
